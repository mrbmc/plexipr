MISSTRESS BARBARA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Even</strong>t presents the leading lady of techno <strong>Misstress Barbara </strong>at dance music boîte <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, September 5th, 2008.</strong></span></p>
<p>Over <strong>Misstress Barbara</strong>'s 12-year career as a DJ/ Producer she has been notorious for her consistently "harder" sound, but now her music has evolved stylistically from a self-described "funky pumpin' techno" vibe to one which she feels is a more "smooth, tech-house and minimal" sound.  The flavor of Misstress Barbara's craft, however, is in perpetual motion as she continually pushes her own artistic boundaries in search of the next unique sound.</p>
<p>Throughout 2007 and into 2008, continuing with her evolution as an artist; Misstress Barbara began work on her first artist album.  Sparked by the tragic passing of a close family member, the sudden influx of emotions began to take the shape of lyrics and became the basis for the now titled album I'm No Human due out in late 2008.  The album is a unique creature, living in the electronic music world, but taking a much more lyric and song driven structure, drawing from her wide spectrum of tastes, creating a musical synthesis…a true artist project. Although an introspective album Misstress Barbara chose to collaborate on certain songs such as; 'is it ok', co-produced with Bjorn Yttling from the group Peter, Bjorn and John.  Barbara also worked with Brazilian Girls, one of the groups that have been a major influence on her throughout the past years, as well as a duet with Canadian singer/ songwritter Sam Roberts.</p>
