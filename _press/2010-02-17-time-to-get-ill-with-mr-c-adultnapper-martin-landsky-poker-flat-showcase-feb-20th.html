<p>There is no denying that <strong>Mr. C</strong> is a legend of dance music.  Over the span of his 20+ years in the scene he has tried his hand at virtually every aspect of it.  Mr.C’s musical career began as an MC in the U.K.  As the vicious front man for the hip hop outfit The Shamen, he was responsible for a string of mainstream and club hits during the early 90’s.  After that came his successful solo career as a DJ/Producer, as well as club owner.  Along with partner Layo Paskin, their clubs <em>The End</em> and <em>AKA Bar</em> provided Londoners with memorable nights for well over a decade.   During their tenure, the venues became two of the city’s most legendary dance establishments.  His many labels include <em>Plink Plonk</em>, <em>The End Recordings</em>, and <em>Superfreq Recordings</em>, which also is the name of his world famous club night.  Mr. C has released countless productions under a variety of aliases for some of the world’s most prestigious techno and house labels including <em>Sexonwax</em> and <em>Hallucination Ltd</em>.</p>
<p>His latest collaborative effort is with New York’s own Adultnapper under the <em><strong>Sycophant Slags</strong></em> moniker.  Their newly released EP on <em>Poker Flat</em>, “<em><strong>Keep Off</strong></em>” is a trippy slice of underground house.  A tight, clean, and superbly produced track, “Keep Off” also marks Mr. C’s return to vocal duties.  With the catchy “<em>sky’s the limit</em>” refrain, the track has immediately lifted itself to late night anthem status.  The EP also features unique interpretations from renowned acts Reboot and The Wighnomy Brothers.  Mr. C has also released his first solo EP in nearly 5 years with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>‘Lunar EP</strong></span><strong>’</strong> on <em>Wagon Repair</em>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lunar EP </span>showcases his diversity with three distinct variations on one common theme.  The sunrise perfect “Full Moon”, deep after hours style “Waxing, and peak time “Dark Moon” come together to form a complete representation of the sounds that make up a Mr.C set.</p>
<p>Mr. C is joined by several of house and techno’s most esteemed artists to showcase <em>Poker Flat Recordings</em>.  His Sycophant Slags partner and Brooklyn’s own master of deep, brooding techno <strong>Adultnapper</strong> will also take to the decks.  Making his long awaited return to New York City will be <strong>Martin Landsky</strong> for a special 5 hour extended set.  Martin’s ability to mix deep music with funky elements and sexy vocals make him a worldwide favorite.  His sets are known to bridge the gap between techno, funk, minimal, and house.  <em>Blk|Market Membership</em>’s own <strong>Taimur + Fahad</strong> are heroes of the New York underground scene. Not only known for throwing some of the city’s finest underground techno events, they are also recognized as two of its best DJ’s with a keen ear for upcoming global talent.  With extended opening duties the duo will showcase the techno sounds which so many around the country have come to love.  Rounding out the bill will be <em>Time To Get Ill</em>’s own <strong>Crazy Larry</strong>.  Larry has brought together this impressive roster of artists dear to his heart for what is sure to be a very special night for all.</p>
