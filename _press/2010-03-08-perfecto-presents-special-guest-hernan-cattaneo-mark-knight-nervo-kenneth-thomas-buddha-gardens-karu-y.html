HERNAN CATTANEO<br />

KENNETH THOMAS<br />
<em>@ Buddha Gardens at Karu &amp; Y</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Oakenfold</strong>’s legendary <em><strong>Perfecto</strong></em> name has been synonymous with all things quality since its inception nearly two decades ago.  From top-notch productions by the world’s most elite artists to the finest events in the business, <em>Perfecto</em> has now transcended from record label to iconic dance music brand.  Following a string of highly successful conference events, <em>Perfecto</em> returns to Miami in the <strong>Buddha Gardens at Karu &amp; Y</strong> with a slew of its best representatives.<strong> Hernan Cattaneo</strong>, <strong>Mark Knight</strong>, <strong>NERVO</strong> and <strong>Kenneth Thomas</strong> will be joined by a very <strong>Special Guest</strong> to bring the <em>Perfecto</em> sounds back to Miami on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 27th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Special Guest</strong>, so exclusive "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named," has been integral to Perfecto since its inception and is highly regarded as one of the first superstar DJs of the era, landing in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most popular DJ. His impact on the world of dance music is undisputed and has been fiercely debated by purists but he is hugely credited with popularizing dance music in America with sweeping major-chord melodics, orchestral synthesizers, and big, dramatic crescendos for the masses.</p>
<p>Argentine hero <strong>Hernan Cattaneo</strong> is an electronic music renaissance man. From his touring, production work to his masterful mix CDs and radio shows, music isn’t just an occupation for Hernan – it’s an existence. Blessed with a warm and honest passion, Hernan’s journey has been rooted with a definitive musical understanding ever since he heard his first 12”s coming out of Detroit, Chicago, and Europe. Both a true DJ’s DJ and a peoples’ favorite, Hernan's career has been filled with accomplishments rivaled by very few. A seminal <em>Renaissance</em> and <em>Perfecto</em> favorite, Hernan's impressive compilation work can only be overshadowed by his extensive tour schedule; bringing him to the finest clubs and festivals throughout the world.</p>
<p>UK DJ/producer and <em>Toolroom Knights</em> head honcho <strong>Mark Knight</strong>’s high octane sets across the dance music spectrum have devastated dance floors throughout the world, while his original studio work and remixes have made him the most in-demand and sought after producer in the business.  With 2 IDMA nominations for ‘<em>Best Global Label</em>’ and ‘<em>Best Global Radio Show</em>’ for the Toolroom Knights radio show, a recent Grammy nomination for the Black Eyed Peas' multi-platinum album ‘The E.N.D’, he also stormed Beatport's 2009 best seller list with 3 of the year’s most popular tracks; “Good Times”, “Music Matters”, and “Flauta Magica.” Mark Knight continues to champion a sound and attitude that’s gained respect from fans and industry people alike, hungry for the integrity of the label’s production skills and the quality of their parties with residencies at Ministry of Sound London, Avalon Hollywood and Pacha NYC.</p>
<p>Transatlantic lady duo <strong>NERVO</strong> have been making quite a splash in the world of dance music recently.  With their hands dipped in all aspect of the scene there seems to be no stone left unturned when these two get down to business.  Hot of the heels of their writing work on David Guetta's Grammy winning "When Love Takes Over", they are now set to release multiple collaborations with platinum artists K$sha on her debut album.  However, their top-notch collaborations do not stop there.  As either writers or producers, NERVO are currently working with the likes of Armin Van Buuren, Roger Sanchez, Laidback Luke, Kylie Minogue and The Pussycat Dolls.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Oakenfold</strong> knows how to spot talent and to him, "<em><strong>Kenneth Thomas</strong> is without doubt one of the most promising young DJs in the electronic scene right now. There is an intelligence and a well defined style to his sets. He's quickly emerging as one to watch in the next generation of superstar DJs.</em>" Following in the footsteps of prior Oakenfold protégé’s Dave Ralph, D:Fuse, and Hernan Cattaneo, the Detroit native and <em>Pefecto</em> A&amp;R guy is now at the forefront of the modern era of progressive dance music.  With global DJ sets, studio work on the likes of <em>Hope</em>, <em>Coldharbour</em> and <em>Perfecto</em>, and the support of one of the greatest figures that dance music has ever seen, Kenneth Thomas is poised to break through in a big way.</p>
