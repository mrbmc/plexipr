<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the return of <em>Coldharbour Recordings</em> boss and new wave trance superstar <strong>Markus Schulz</strong> along with NYC favorite <strong>Zack Roth</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> with a special<em> Proton Sessions</em> in the basement on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 7th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Through his natural audience affinity, flawless mixing and innate tune selection, <strong>Markus Schulz</strong> has wowed crowds in every major area of the world for over a decade. Though an active DJ and producer during the 1990’s, it was not until the 2000’s when he began to reach mass audiences with his, now trademark, trance sound. Now a regular fixture at the world’s most famous clubs, arenas and festivals, Schulz lays down his unique musical vision on a weekly basis. In Europe, he has smashed events like Trance Energy, Nature One, Dance Valley, Creamfields and Global Gathering. At home in the USA, he has graced the decks of the colossal Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Festivals, as well as the inaugural Electric Zoo.  After several significant showings in the Top 100 DJs chart, he now ranks as one of the top 10 DJs in the world.</p>
<p>On top of his globetrotting tour schedule, Markus manages to broadcast his weekly radio show, the <em>Global DJ Broadcast</em>.  The show puts a spotlight on Schulz dark, melodic trance sound on over 50 stations worldwide.  Now in its fifth year, the show has continued to be a beacon for an always-growing throng of trance &amp; progressive dance fans.   His label <em>Coldharbour Recordings</em> also provides Schulz with a platform to release his own material as well as work from some of progressive music’s most gifted producers.  Now on the threshold of its 100th release “Dark Heart Waiting”, Coldharbour has firmly established itself as a premier destination for quality trance and progressive music.</p>
<p>Now, after 18 months of studio sessions, Schulz is set to release <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do You Dream</strong></span>, the follow up to his 2007 acclaimed artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Progression</span>.  Since the earliest days of his label, fans and critics alike have seen Schulz as both the leading-light pioneer and ultimate standard-bearer of trance’s new wave. The album instantly absorbs the listener back into that world, delivering a masterful start-to-finish audio experience.  From the first track <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do You Dream</span> charts a tightly-plotted course uniquely his own, embracing housey percussion, swirling atmospheric progressive, drum &amp; bass-ish bass lines, stunningly-cultivated vibrant trance riffs and a myriad of other sounds, effects and minutiae styles.  The album features some of the scene’s finest vocalists including Jennifer Rene, Justine Suissa, and Ana Criado and contains tracks which have been highlights of Markus Schulz sets since 2008, like “The New World”, “Perception”, and the album’s title track.  You can also check out Markus’ sound on his latest mix for April’s DJ Magazine, which marks the 15th anniversary of UK clubbing institution <em>The Gallery</em>.</p>
<p><em>‘Do You Dream’ will be released on June 12 on Armada Music.</em></p>
