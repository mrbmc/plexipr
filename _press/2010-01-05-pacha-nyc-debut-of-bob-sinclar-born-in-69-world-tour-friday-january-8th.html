<em>Pacha NYC presents </em><br />
The Pacha NYC Debut<br />
BOB SINCLAR<br />
‘Born in 69’ World Tour</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the Pacha NYC debut of legendary DJ/Producer <strong>Bob Sinclar</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, January 8th, 2009</strong></span>. Currently touring on his  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Born in 69</strong></span> (Yellow), Sinclar is ready to show NYC what peace, love and flower power is all about.</p>
<p>When describing <strong>Bob Sinclar</strong>'s new album he responded with, “<em>I got the concept of Born In 69 by brainstorming around the theme of peace, love and flower power</em>.”  With this mantra in mind, the album delivers a fresh hippie theme and a worldly vibe with eclectic sounds inspired by the various cities Sinclar recorded in: Los Angeles, Paris, New York, and even Jamaica. No matter where you are, each track calls upon the flower children of the world to dance like no one’s watching, with a handful of care-free songs featuring contributions from masters of their own genres including: dancehall king Shabba Ranks, the legendary hip hop group Sugarhill Gang, and well-respected house DJ Ron Carroll. Sinclar's choice of unlikely collaborations solidifies his creative taste for risk taking and mixing styles to create something new and exciting.</p>
<p>Exciting has never been an issue with Mr Sinclar. Taking his name sake from a famous classic porn star in France, right from the get-go, Sinclar was an international super star. With smash hits on imprint Yellow from as early as 1996 all the way to May's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born in 69</span>, Bob has shown France and the rest of the world that he is the top house producer of this modern dance era. Whether he is headlining sold out clubs in Ibiza or producing hits with Sugar Hill Gang, Bob Sinclar is always at the top of his game.</p>
<p>2009 has been a notable year for Bob Sinclar. He was voted Best Dance Artist in Belgium at the notable <em>TMF Awards 2009</em> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born in 69</span> has already sold 300,000 albums in France and has obtained golden record status. Back with his first album release in 2 years, the most prolific DJ in house music, Sinclar shows no signs of stopping with the announcement of his 'Born in 69 World Tour'.</p>
