Ferry Corsten<br />
"Twice In A Blue Moon" Album Release Tour</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Made Event</em> </strong>presents Dutch superstar DJ and producer, <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong> in New York City for his "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Twice In A </em></strong><strong><em>Blue Moon</em></strong></span> " album release tour at <strong>Webster Hall</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, February 28th, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twice In A Blue Moon</span> is the highly anticipated third artist album by trance heavyweight <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong>. The Dutch superstar has consistently shown his electronic talent through slick production and epic DJ sets, with his success being illustrated in the DJ Top 100 poll top ten where Ferry has had a residency for the past five years.</p>
<p>After the massive 2006-artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">L.E.F</span> and prior to that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right Of Way</span> back in 2003, Ferry Corsten has been anything but quiet. This year alone saw Netherlands’ most famous export remixing U2, Nelly Furtado and the new anthemic single "Human" from The Killers, putting on the massive 12,000 capacity event "Full On Ferry", where eight hour sets don’t go a miss plus touring at mega-parties around the world. Now back with artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twice In</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Blue Moon</span>, Ferry Corsten presents 12 upfront electronic cuts that will appeal to dance fans and clubbers alike.</p>
<p>The album includes uplifting trance tracks such as "Radio Crash" (the first single), Shanti and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twice In A Blue Moon</span>, to the big electro sound of "Brain Box" that we all know Ferry for. A little wink to the 80’s can be found in "We Belong", to the beautiful and fragile "Visions of Blue" and "Gabriella’s Sky", an ode to his newborn daughter. The vocal productions "Black Velvet", "Feel You" and "Made Of Love" are beautiful melodic creations that will soon be named as Corsten classics. The new single, "Made of Love" featuring the enchanting vocals of Betsie Larkin comes with remixes by Super8 &amp; Tab, Duderstadt, PUSH end Bobina.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twice In A Blue Moon</span> gives a fine impression of the DJ sets Ferry Corsten plays today and perfectly illustrates his creative skills and abilities, showing why his sound really does appeal to all. Evolving his skills to match his signature style, this album shows why he deserves to be titled one of the best DJ-producers in the world.</p>
