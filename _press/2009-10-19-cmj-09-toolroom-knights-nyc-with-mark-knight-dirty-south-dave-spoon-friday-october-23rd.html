<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the latest epic installment of the<em><strong> Toolroom Knights NYC</strong></em> residency with <strong>Mark Knight</strong>, <strong>Dirty South</strong>, and <strong>Dave Spoon</strong> for a special <strong>CMJ Music Marathon <span style="color: #ff0000;">09</span></strong> event on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Friday, October 23, 2009</span></strong></span>.</p>
<p>The embodiment of the modern DJ, <strong>Mark Knight</strong>’s legacy already ranks him as a leading player in dance music culture’s evolution into the digital and globalised age. His high octane sets, which treble and bass their way right across the dance music spectrum, have caused dance floor carnage in every corner of the world, whilst his original productions and slick remixes make his studio skills the most in-demand and sought after in the business. In 2009, Mark Knight and his Toolroom imprint has continued to experience unmatched success within the world of dance music.  Starting with his production “Good Times” and the massive collaboration with D. Ramirez of Underworld’s “Downpipe”, Toolroom Records has continued its trend of top-notch releases while continuing to grow as a record label and as a brand.  It celebrated its 100th release earlier this year and the Toolroom Knights club night is rapidly becoming one of the premier destinations in all of clubland.  Since its inception in 2006, Toolroom Knights have successfully conquered dance floors the world over, hosting show stopping parties from Ministry of Sound London to Amnesia Ibiza, and everywhere in between.  Keep a lookout for Mark’s latest remix for, none other than, U2’s “Moment of Surrender”.</p>
<p><strong>Dirty South</strong> aka Dragan Roganovic’s prolific productions and remixes have propelled him into onto the worldwide stage of DJing with much aplomb. His catalog of remixes already includes a GRAMMY nomination and work for a wide range of revered artists such as; Depeche Mode, Mark Ronson, Tracey Thorn, Snoop Dogg, Roger Sanchez, Josh Wink, Tiësto, Chris Lake, Fedde Le Grande, Ferry Corsten and U2.   Production wise, you can’t get much better.  Besides the successes he has had on his own, with releases like “It’s Too Late”, “Let It Go”, “The End” and “Alamo”, Dirty South has joined forces with some of best producers in the world and created anthems such as “Open Your Heart” with Axwell and “How Soon Is Now” with David Guetta and Sebastian Ingrosso.  With only a few short years under his belt in the international production scene, Dirty South’s potential to achieve tremendous musical heights seems limitless.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Spoon</strong> began his voyage into music aged 3 with his first mix tape and then at 10 was forced to play the trumpet. From these humble beginnings Spoon has gone on to be at the forefront of the global Dance music scene since his 2004 debut on Toolroom records. Last year, Spoon was invited to host BBC Radio 1’s prolific ‘In New DJs We Trust’ radio show and the future looks ever brighter for Portsmouth’s official number one export with his own label Televizion going from strength to strength and DJ gigs booked across the globe.</p>
<p>This event is taking place as an official part of the legendary <strong>CMJ Music Marathon <span style="color: #ff0000;">09</span></strong>, which is roaring through New York City from Tuesday, October 20 through Saturday, October 24. The Marathon is the largest and longest-running music industry event of its kind.
