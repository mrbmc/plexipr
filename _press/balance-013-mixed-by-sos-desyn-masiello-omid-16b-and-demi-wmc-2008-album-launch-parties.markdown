<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Balance 013 mixed by SOS<br />
(Desyn Masiello, Omid 16B and Demi)<br />
WMC 2008 Album Launch Parties<br />
EQ Recordings / US Release Date: April 29th</strong></p>
<p>Featuring a spot-on selection of sounds from yesterday, today and tomorrow’s electronic maestros, including an eclectic mixture of the likes of Aeroplane, Aphex Twin, Bryan Ferry, The Cure, Loco Dice, Speedy J, Omid 16B and more…</p>
<p>After 12 albums of cutting-edge dance music from all corners of the globe, EQ’s visionary Balance series has evolved into a never ending search to find the perfect equilibrium: the happy marriage of integrity, innovation and entertainment. <em>Balance 013</em> continues this great tradition but gives it to you supersized, with three DJs blazing a trail of 56 tracks across three jam-packed CDs.</p>
<p>At the helm of this voyage is London-based DJ collective SOS (aka SexOnSubstance), featuring Demi, Desyn Masiello and Omid 16B. As friends, producers, DJs, label owners – and model clubland citizens – Demi, Desyn and Omid are three of the most passionate talents working in electronic music today. Taking inspiration from their SexOnWax and Deeper Substance imprints to form SOS in 2004, they’ve built a first-rate reputation for quality music, inventive mixing and an infectious party spirit, whether it’s on a boat along the Thames, deep inside Bedrock or Ministry of Sound, or glowing in the sun in Ibiza or Miami. Like Danny Krivit, François K and Joe Claussell’s legendary Body &amp; Soul connection before them, the chemistry between the members of SOS makes for a proper three-headed DJ monster.</p>
<p><em>Balance 013</em> marks the first time the trio has committed their energetic and eclectic sound to CD, and the result is nothing short of mind-blowing. Having locked themselves away for weeks, submerged in their home studios, SOS painstakingly programmed and pieced together a three-disc opus using many of their signature re-edits, top-drawer treasures from underground troves, and a few kinky surprises out of left field.</p>
<p>The journey begins with crashing waves and a sublime guitar solo. Omid’s track ‘Seagull’, made using a simple four-track when he was in an early-90s band called The Reunion, is heard here for the very first time. We then glide into a realm of guitar loops and spaced out disco. And from there we catch a chugging, hypnotic groove that takes us right into the heart of the mix. Here the SOS sound snakes cleverly between cosmic dub, ambient breakbeats, Arabian horns and all things house. It’s a playground perfect for the more experimental shades of SOS’s palette.</p>
<p>The next disc continues where the first left off with The Cure’s ‘Lullaby’. However, this time it’s a special up-tempo edit that blends the blissful nostalgia of the original with a new, dreamy soundscape that lies beyond. (Actually getting clearance to use ‘Lullaby’ in this context involved another massive effort by SOS, which ultimately led to Robert Smith himself helping the guys out!) Continuing to build the mix, SOS passes through the deepest analogue territories before hitting the acid funk running. In true SOS style, things later take a turn for the surreal when the rude boys splice it up to ask, in the voice of Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury, ‘is this the real life’? After an infusion of twisted, percussive techno, the energy flow reaches a climax before dropping back two decades to the timeless party sounds of Inner City’s ‘Big Fun’.</p>
<p>The final mix is every bit as epic and compelling. It’s also more club-orientated, with tracks cherry-picked from a brotherhood of underground talents. Sure enough at times it gets pretty intense, with prime dancefloor cuts from the likes of Aphex Twin, but it’s always in keeping with the ebb and flow of the project. Effortlessly organic and seamlessly dynamic, the sequence progresses, releasing pressure and leading to the atmospheric finale entitled ‘Full of E_mty’ from Omid’s <em>Like 3 Ears</em> And 1 Eye album.</p>
<p>Fair dinkum, SOS. Individually they are dynamite; collectively they are the bomb. Taking the art of DJing, moving it forward and making it truly progressive. Three DJs, three CDs and an explosive sequence of trip-tech sounds from right around the world, mixed the way SOS plays live – welcome to <em>Balance 013</em>!</p>
