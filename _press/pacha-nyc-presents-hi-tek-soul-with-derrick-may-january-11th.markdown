Pacha NYC presents<br />
Detroit Techno godfather &amp; House Music legend...<br />
DERRICK MAY<br />
HI-TEK SOUL<br />
Pacha Debut!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> welcomes Detroit techno godfather and house music legend <strong>Derrick May</strong>! The man behind one of the biggest, most influential electronic music bombs ever...the one and only: "Strings of Life"<br />
Derrick is joined by NYC local favorites <em>Sleepy &amp; Boo</em>.</p>
<p>In 2007, <strong>Derrick May</strong> debuted Hi-Tek Soul, his worldwide techno platform, in NYC to a rapturous response. Now in 2008, Derrick is stepping things up with a big-room assault as Hi-Tek Soul debuts at New York's undisputed nightlife champion: Pacha New York. For those who missed his previous intimate schoolings in proper dance music, this will be a chance to see one of the true historical figures in the international underground scene schooling the dancefloor on what true techno music is all about. It's rare to see techno presented in a big room venue like Pacha these days, so this night should not be missed.</p>
<p>From the genesis of techno in Detroit in the mid-80s right up until today, Derrick May has never slowed in his pursuit to present his vision for electronic music. 2007 was another busy year for Derrick, as he was consistently spreading his Hi-Tek Soul vision and sound to clubs and festivals around the world. From New York to Australia, Miami to London, including an appearance at the massive Monegros festival in Spain, Derrick May has worked relentlessly to establish Hi-Tek Soul as his expression of what techno is and should be. "Techno as a name, as a label, as a brand has been really abused," May says. "And basically where Hi-Tek Soul comes from is a way to salvage it. Its credibility, as a musical art form, gets lost in the shuffle of all the bullshit of is now known as techno."</p>
<p>With May as the focus, as well as a rotating roster of likeminded DJs and artists, Hi-Tek Soul highlights Derrick's singular approach to DJing. With a firm focus on building the energy of the crowd, Derrick always mesmerizes in the DJ booth. Furiously mixing together classics with new tracks, dropping EQs and cutting levels out, May employs an arsenal of basslines, synthesizers and hypnotic, rhythmic drums to keep the grooves pulsating. His is the true sound of Detroit, an attitude and a style that simply cannot be replicated by anyone else. As a producer and label owner of the revered Transmat imprint, Derrick has authored numerous techno classics - with his seminal Rhythim is Rhythim release "Strings of Life" still the king of Detroit techno anthems.</p>
<p>Warming up the night will be Pacha residents Sleepy &amp; Boo, with Basic NYC locals rocking the Pacha basement all night. Sleepy &amp; Boo have been the driving force behind Hi-Tek Soul in NYC, presenting two prior installments with Derrick May and Stacey Pullen at the Sullivan Room in 2007. Together with Pacha they are excited to present of dance music's most visionary figures on the proper clubbing platform.</p>
