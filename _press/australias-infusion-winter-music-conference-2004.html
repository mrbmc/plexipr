<h2>Australia\'s INFUSION @ Winter Music Conference 2004</h2>
<p>On the heels of their smash hit \'Girls Can Be Cruel\', INFUSION will be performing live in Room One at renowned UK club FABRIC on Friday, March 5th. The single - just released on Dave Seaman\'s AudioTherapy label - has already won accolades by being included on MixMag\'s February 2004 CD insert Pete Tong\'s Top 2004 Tunes, as well as being heralded for sounding <i>\"like nothing else in dance music at the moment\"</i> (M8 Magazine).</p>
<p>Do not miss the opportunity to see them at Winter Music Conference 2004 this year. Every performance is 100% original. No pre-programming means no two sets are ever truly alike. The energy and charisma they put into their performance is infectious and truly captures the imagination of their audiences. They\'re bringing back the \"rock music attitude,\" [says Pete Tong] to dance music. Along with their artist album nearing completion, slated for release later this year on BMG - Infusion is on the brink of great things. </p>
