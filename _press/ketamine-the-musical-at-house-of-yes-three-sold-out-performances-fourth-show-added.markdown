Following the initial announcement of **‘Ketamine: The Musical,’** an overwhelming demand has led to Brooklyn’s House of Yes extending their run for two additional performances, both of which have now sold out well in advance. Described as a “psychedelic, hyper-creative, hyper-weird, work of performance art” by director and venue co-owner Anya Sapozhnikova when speaking to Brooklyn Paper.  “We want it to be a little dissociative, but it’s basically a circus and physical theater musical.”

**‘Ketamine: The Musical’**  is a one of a kind trippy musical aiming to educate and entertain as viewers set in for the trip of a lifetime and watch one man’s journey through multiple mind-altering states of a drug-addled anaesthetic user after he takes ketamine — an animal tranquilizer that has become a party drug notorious both for its psychedelic qualities and tendency to leave one jelly-legged. The show will feature 12 high-flying aerial acts and will be an immersive, participatory, psychoactive and dissociative spectacle.

Running at approximately 75 minutes, viewers will be seated because obviously you can’t stand on ketamine. The trippy musical is poised to invoke discussion about the drug and drug addiction. “What I’m interested in doing is removing the shame and stigma around drug use because that’s what prevents people from getting help,” said Sapozhnikova.

**About House of Yes:**\
House of Yes opened its third iteration in Bushwick at the beginning of 2016 to become a beacon of NYC nightlife after shuttering its doors too soon in East Williamsburg three years ago. Original partners Anya Sapozhnikova and Kae Burke, teamed up with Ilan Telmont and Justin Ahiyon to build out the best venue ever with a little help from their friends, seeding a Kickstarter campaign for $92,340 (original goal: $60,000). The space includes an art-deco restaurant parlor, a spectacularly decorated warehouse-sized performance space, a courtyard with kitschy repurposed decor, and a clandestine mini-club. House of Yes is now the home of circus spectacles, immersive cinema, burlesque and cabaret shows, aerial extravaganzas, nightlife parties, morning raves, brunch, BBQs, and bubble baths, all with superior sound and exemplary service. Each night is specially curated to create an immersive experience with music, theatrics, and performances to titillate the senses and expand your mind, unlike any other venue in Brooklyn right now.
