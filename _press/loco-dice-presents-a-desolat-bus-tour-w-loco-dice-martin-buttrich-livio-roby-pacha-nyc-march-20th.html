<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the New York stop of the renowned label’s <strong>Desolat Bus Tour</strong> featuring label heads <strong>Loco Dice </strong>and <strong>Martin Buttrich</strong> along with Romanian representatives <strong>Livio &amp; Roby</strong> on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Saturday, March 20th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Every so often a DJ or producer comes along who inspires the collective imagination of the clubbing world. <strong>Loco Dice</strong> is someone who can piece together these intangible moods with a uniquely direct approach. Whether it is his DJ sets or productions on labels like <em>M_nus</em>, <em>Cadenza</em>, <em>Ovum</em>, <em>Cocoon</em> or his own <em>Desolat,</em> he manages to merge perspectives in a delicate sense of sound and atmosphere, underpinned with a solid, physical groove. His DJ sets are known to be spontaneous orchestrations fueled by the nuances of a crowd, location, or venue.  It is this innate understanding of people: what they sense, what they feel, what they want to imagine that distinguishes him from other DJs.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Buttrich</strong> has been involved with such a large number of productions since his start, it would give even the most eager clubber a difficult time finding them all. Since the beginning, Buttrich has kept his head down and worked as a studio producer for over a decade, producing records with the likes of Timo Maas and Loco Dice.  His work with Loco Dice has appeared on labels like <em>Ovum</em>,<em> M_nus</em> and<em> Cocoon</em>.  His dark, twisted sound produces a fiercely isolated groove and has come to embody the dominant sound of dance floors which has made Martin Buttrich and Loco Dice productions the in demand sound across the world.  It is with this success that <em>Desolat Music </em>was born.  Buttrich has still found time to produce work under his own name, releasing records on <em>Planet E</em>, and<em> Four:Twenty</em>.  Buttrich is not only a studio wizard though. He can be seen playing his live set at all premier clubs around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Livio &amp; Roby</strong> are two of Romania’s most elite producers and DJs.  With a great understanding of dance music and exceptional production skills the duo have produced and remixed tracks appearing on labels like <em>Cecille,</em> <em>Fumakilla</em>, <em>Junior Boy´s Own</em> and <em>Viva</em>.  Their distinct sound ranges from the realms of deep house to classic techno. Holding residencies at several premier clubs in their homeland including Studio Martin and Kristal, as well as being major players at venues throughout the continent, Livio &amp; Roby are poised to become the next great stars of dance music.  This was greatly influenced by Loco Dice when the famed DJ asked the duo to join the Desolat family in 2008, thus giving them a highly visible platform to grow and develop their sound for audiences around the globe.</p>
