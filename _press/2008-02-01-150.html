<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> &amp; <strong>Rhythmism.com</strong> are proud to present the <em>Rhythmism.com 4 Year Anniversary Party</em> featuring <strong>JAMES ZABIELA</strong>, DEADMAU5 and young upstarts <strong>THE MARTINEZ BROTHERS</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, February 22, 2008.</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the most technically talented DJs on the planet- <strong>JAMES ZABIELA</strong> returns for his Pacha residency, in conjunction with NYC’s foremost online dance music community Rhythmism.com. James is looking forward to the special date and exclaims, “I'm super excited to be coming back to my Pacha residency in New York after a short break. Bring it on!" At the end of last year he also released a 4-track EP of all original material, titled ‘Perseverance EP’. The EP showcases a mature, polished side to James’ production and is a testament to where he sits today as a producer.</p>
<p><strong>Rhythmism.com</strong> is New York’s leading interactive publication covering the latest on New York nightlife, global dance music news, clubbing and specializing in NYC electronic music events for a music &amp; technology savvy audience with discerning tastes. Over four years, it has developed into the most comprehensive online resource for the NYC clubbing community and provides a forum for electronic music aficionados, clubbers, students and industry professionals. It is driven by a community of people – nightlife industry professionals (promoters, DJs, labels), music fans, friends and newcomers - who share a passion for nightlife, electronic music and urban living.</p>
<p>Joining Zabiela is Toronto’s newest rising star <strong>Deadmau5</strong> (pronounce ‘dead mouse’), who has been recognized as a rising, notable producer by dance titans such as Tiesto and Armin van Buuren and as varied as François K. and Zabiela. With a slew of new productions, remixes gracing more than 15 compilations in the last year and a new record label Mau5trap Recordings, Deadmau5 is poised to release his debut studio album in 2008 to much worldwide anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>The Martinez Brothers</strong> have been causing a quite a hubbub and justly so. Having emerged on the scene under the tutelage of mentor Dennis Ferrer, these two teenage brothers have already achieved a quite a bit of dance music notoriety with gigs at Shelter, 718 Sessions, P.S. 1, and Pacha. Their first single, “My Rendition” was a bonafide club hit last summer and their energetic sets are not only a product of their youth but of their charismatic, high-powered DJ sets.</p>
<p><em>“[James Zabiela] One of the only DJs able to rock just about any global dancefloor to it’s foundations whilst still pulling off mind-stretching technical trickery with gadgets that wouldn’t be out of place on the Starship Enterprise.”</em> -DJ Mag</p>
<p><em>“Deadmau5 has deftly tapped a zeitgeist sound that exists between the operatic drama of trance, the Teutonic precision of techno, and the Baptist rhapsody of house music.”</em> – LA Citybeat</p>
<p><em>“The supremely talented (and very young) Martinez Brothers bring their energetic house stylings to Pacha.”</em> – Time Out New York</p>
<p><em>“What you really want to know is (a) How to pay less to get into the ones that do charge, and (b) how to get in at all. Start with Rhythmism’s local party roster, which focuses mostly on house, techno and trance artists and is searchable by genre or date.”</em> – Time Out New York</p>
