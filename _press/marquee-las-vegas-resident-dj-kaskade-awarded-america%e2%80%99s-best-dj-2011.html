<div style="text-align: center;"><em>America's Best DJ 2011: Kaskade</em></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kaskade</strong> was officially awarded with the <em>2011 America’s Best DJ</em> title this past Sunday, October 9th, at Marquee Nightclub in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award ceremony, held in The Library at Marquee, and the following party—with Kaskade and Scotty Boy (featuring a surprise appearance from LMFAO) on the decks—culminated <em>DJ Times</em> magazine’s three-month-long promotion, which included a 24-date America’s Best DJ Summer Tour Presented by Pioneer DJ. Marquee DJs Erick Morillo  and EDX were also in the club for the celebration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After winning the 2009 ABDJ award, LA-based turntable legend Z-Trip returned with a vengeance in 2011, finishing in third place. (Second-place finisher Skrillex was on tour and unavailable.) Z-Trip was on hand to accept his plaque and see Pioneer DJ’s “Davey Dave” Arevalo present Kaskade his spoils, a specially engraved, gold-plated Pioneer DJM-900nexus mixer. <em>“Thanks to Pioneer, who make such great DJ products, and thanks to DJ Times,” said Kaskade (aka L.A.-based Ryan Raddon). “It’s especially nice to get this award from DJ Times because I grew up reading the magazine. As a young DJ, it was great to learn about new tricks and techniques—so thank you, DJ Times.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After handing over commemorative plaques to Kaskade and Z-Trip, <em>DJ Times</em> Editor Jim Tremayne reflected on the 6<sup>th</sup> annual promotion. <em>“This year, the America’s Best DJ Summer Tour Presented by Pioneer DJ took DJ Times to 20-plus events across the country,” he said. “So after a season of shows that produced unprecedented levels of fan balloting, we were thrilled to see America’s Best DJ culminate with a first-class closing event at Marquee inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. After finishing second last year, Kaskade is the deserving 2011 winner and, judging from the reaction to his Marquee performance this past Sunday night, he’s still a DJ who energizes his loyal fanbase. Thank you, Kaskade, thank you, Marquee, and thank you, Pioneer DJ.”</em></p>
