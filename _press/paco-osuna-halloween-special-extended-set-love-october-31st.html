<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
Paco Osuna<br />
Special Extended Halloween Set<br />
<em>Come dressed to kill</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the Spanish techno Inquisidor <strong>Paco Osuna</strong> for a spooky special Halloween extended set at <strong>Love</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, October 31, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Paco Osuna</strong> proves once again that he’s in a league of his own when it comes to serving up futuristic nuggets of southern fried techno. It really is anything but minimal these days as layer upon layer of rich textures combine, guaranteeing maximum overdrive. And it’s not only the choice and combination of sounds, or the full-on party vibe Paco instinctively achieves that drive, clarity and warmth, his breathtaking mixdowns add a 3 dimensional quality, enhancing the all round listening experience. The stunning soundsystem at Love is sure to give those pesky trick-or-treaters something to scream about.</p>
<p>With his massive, samba-esque bassline, avalanches of analogue EFX, loose drum crescendos and memorable vocal samples. Paco takes us on a journey of huge build-ups and intense, reverb drenched breakdowns to deliver some heart in the mouth moments - just light the fuse and watch him burn the dancefloor.<br />
