<div style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> proudly presents the return of the international tastemaker and multi talented frontman for <em>The Black Eyed Peas</em>,  <strong>Will.i.am</strong> along with <strong>Richard Vission</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday July 30th, 2010</strong></span>.</div>
<p>What is there that can be said about the international superstar Will.i.am that isn’t already known around the world.  Widely recognized as the frontman of the multi platinum hip hop group, The Black Eyed Peas, <strong>Will.i.am</strong> is a true pop music hitmaker who also happens to be an avid follower and lover of dance music culture.  The group's latest album “The E.N.D.” for which they received 6 Grammy Nominations and entered Billboard’s Top 200 album chart at number 1 and spent 26 consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 chart with “Boom Boom Pow” and “I Gotta Feeling”.   The album featured production from such established dance music figures as Mark Knight and, of course, David Guetta.  The Guetta produced “I Gotta Feeling” immediately became a worldwide anthem, holding the top chart position for 14 weeks.  Since then, Will.I.Am has been featured on another Guetta bomb “I Wanna Go Crazy”, as well as material from the likes of Boys Noize, Fedde le Grand, and Steve Aoki.  With the popularity of the hip hop and electronic hybrid sound seemingly increasing by the day, one will be hard pressed to find a figure more responsible for its rise then Will.i.am.  The self described “electro” DJ first played <em>Pacha NYC</em> back in November 2009 to a capacity crowd. With a line around the block and a few high profile surprise guests, New York’s only super club provided the perfect venue for his unique brand of mash ups, edits, electro-house, live MCing and multiple other DJ tricks.  Fresh back from headlining David Guetta’s infamous F*** Me I’m Famous party with Afrojack at Pacha Ibiza, the 7 time Grammy award winner returns to New York for an event not to be missed!</p>
<p>Playing alongside Will.i.am is a DJ who is no stranger to dance music success.  Grammy nominated remixer/ producer <strong>Richard Vission</strong> has been rocking dance floors around the world for over a decade now.   The Los Angeles native has remixed the likes of Radiohead, U2, The Black Eyed Peas, Timbaland, Prince, Lady Gaga and David Bowie, as well as put out a stream of successful original productions like "Somebody", "Never Be Alone" and his latest collaboration with Static Revenger “I Like That”. Vission consistently ranks in the TOP 30 USA DJs and continues to show no signs of slowing down, celebrating a million selling career while staying true to his underground roots.</p>
