Everyone from techno newcomers to seasoned industry pros come together on the dance floor, all ready to do their part and <em><strong>Save the Cannibals!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FEBRUARY 7 - MATTHEW DEAR WITH DEREK PLASLAIKO</strong><br />
Techno has long been synonymous with Detroit, but two of its favorite sons Matthew Dear and Derek Plaslaiko, now call New York their home base. This week, Matthew plays an extended 5+ hour set! Since Matthew's first single for Ghostly International - 1999's "Hands Up For Detroit", both he and the label have become fixtures of the international electronic music scene. Most recently, his eagerly-awaited Body Language vol. 7 mix for German's Get Physical label is an intimate journey into the creative heartcore of Matthew himself, shot through with pop panache and a propulsive, party-minded momentum, while also exploring the sensuous side of cutting edge dancefloor music.  Special guest Derek Plaslaiko, also an artist on Spectral Sound - Ghostly's dancefloor-based offshoot, celebrates with his highly acclaimed Spectral Sound Vol. 2 mix CD to commemorate the label's 50th release. StC Podcast Episode 3 with Derek Plaslaiko is available now!</p>

<p><strong>FEBRUARY 14  - CASSY WITH ANTHONY PARASOLE</strong><br />
Berlin's first lady of Techno, Cassy is also one of the esteemed Save The Cannibals residents. She'll explore the deepest territories of house and techno in her 100% vinyl-only sets. Expect everything from classic house and techno to deep throbbing 909 influenced house intermingled with her vocal stylings on her own productions that can be heard throughout the night. Her own club residency at Panorama Bar has become a benchmark for techno tourists and natives alike and puts her in a class of her own, and she's sure to make her impression in the concrete jungle. Bunker's very own henchman and label boss Anthony Parasole will be this week's special guest. After a sold out first release, and more on the way, this New York City native is sure to deliver the electricity to jump start the night off right.</p>

<p><strong>FEBRUARY 21 - LEE BURRIDGE WITH DENNIS RODGERS</strong><br />
Lee Burridge is a perennial New York favorite and his last sold-out appearance at Cielo this past summer, still has them talking. During a hectic world DJ schedule, Lee managed to put out one of the standout Resident Advisor Podcasts of the year (RA.129) "All Day I Dream Of Her." This lovelorn set of ethereal, melodic techno is perfect for cold winter days, but his deep, wobbly, wonky, bass-oriented sounds are made for moving on the dancefloor. Buy the ticket, take the ride. Get on board for Lee's 40th birthday world tour! Everyone's favorite Robot Dennis Rodgers will set the stage and pace for the night since it'll sure to be one of those long, crazy winter nights.</p>

<p><strong>FEBRUARY 28 - MARTIN LANDSKY &amp; KONRAD BLACK WITH CONNIE</strong><br />
Does Martin Landsky play the sexiest techno in the business? After blow-up sets in Miami and Detroit last year coupled with a devastating afterhours performance at Rebel for Sunday School for Degenerates New York, Martin returns for a follow-up lesson in house, techno, with hints of acid. The Intim label headmaster puts together a portfolio with everything from flawless mixing to sexy vocals that shows why he is hailed as one of the top DJs in the upper class of the Techno community. No stranger to detention, Berlin transplant Konrad Black concludes his own U.S. tour, to coincide with his turn at  the Watergate compilation series for the esteemed, eponymous Berlin nightclub. Join the fray early for Connie, hot off her first release on Airdrop, this techno femme can hold her own against the Berlin invasion.</p>
