Benny Soto presents<br />
718 Sessions<br />
featuring music by<br />
DANNY KRIVIT &amp; JOE CLAUSSELL</strong></p>
<p>One of NYC's venerable clubbing institutions <strong>718 Sessions</strong> returns to <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> this Sunday, November 9th, 2008. Now in its 6th year, 718 Sessions continues to champion soulful classics and house music to a multi-culti diverse crowd spanning many generations. DJ doyen <strong>Danny Krivit</strong> hems the party with over 35+ years of experience, from guest DJ'ing at the Paradise Garage in the 70's to being a resident at the legendary Body &amp; Soul parties alongside Francois K. and Joaquin "Joe" Claussell, Krivit is widely known for his custom edits of legendary house and disco records. This month, Krivit is joined by fellow Body &amp; Soul cohort <strong>Joe Claussell</strong>.</p>
<p>This week's Time Out New York "Essential NY 2008" issue lists 150 NYC musts. While NYC's nightworld is a land of endless possibilities, TONY names 718 Sessions as one of the few outposts it can't live without.</p>
<p>"[718 Sessions] If soulful disco and R&amp;B-based house are Gotham's gift to the dance-music universe, then Danny Krivit is the city's top Santa Claus. It doesn't matter that the party bounces from venue to venue: Wherever it ends up, it's one of the best shindigs in town." -Time Out New York "Essential NY 2008"</p>
