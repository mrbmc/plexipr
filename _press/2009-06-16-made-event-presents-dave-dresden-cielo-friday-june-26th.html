DAVE DRESDEN</strong><br />
(GABRIEL &amp; DRESDEN)</p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the exclusive NYC residency of <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 26, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Dresden</strong>, DJ and producer formerly of Gabriel &amp; Dresden, continues his prolific production work with new partner: Mikael Johnston. Dresden continues to relish the opportunity to work with others. “<em>I’m not afraid to say I'm a collaborator. That's who I am,</em>” says Dresden. <em>“Being in G&amp;D sort of created these huge shoes that I have to fill that’s why I’ve done a lot of collaborations with people that I admire and respect their production skills.”</em> Already citing two Billboard Hot Club Play chart toppers with remixes for Lily Allen’s “The Fear”, and Nadia Ali’s “Love Story,” Dresden along with his studio partner Mikael Johnston, are carving a well earned niche onto the dancefloor. The new team has just finished work on BT’s “Unbreakable” with vocals from The Catherine Wheels Rob Dickenson, “A Better Man” by up-and-comer JD Webb, a new Katy Perry remix, and are wrapping up their remix of The Crystal Method’s “Black Rainbows”.</p>
<p>Dave Dresden is a veteran in the dance music industry with stints in radio, journalism and his successful partnership with Josh Gabriel, which led to 18 No. 1 positioned singles and remixes on Billboard's Club Play Chart.</p>
