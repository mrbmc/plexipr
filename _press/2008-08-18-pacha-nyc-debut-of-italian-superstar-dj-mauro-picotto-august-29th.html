The Pacha NYC debut of Italian superstar<br />
DJ MAURO PICOTTO<br />
Meganite Ibiza</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents the debut of mega-Italian DJ <strong>MAURO PICOTTO </strong>at mega-club <strong>Pacha</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, August 29th</strong></span>, 2008 for an unforgettable night of his pulsating electronic grooves. This special NYC night heralds his new 2xCD compilation Mauro Picotto presents Meganite Ibiza, featuring many of his biggest hits to date with new remixes and edits by Mauro, his team of likeminded studio manipulators and others.</p>
<p>Italian techno titan <strong>Mauro Picotto</strong> launched his Meganite at Winter Music Conference back in 2002, which has since morphed into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The event has become a phenomenon, going from strength to strength, hosting nights all over the world and this year returning to Ibiza for its fifth successful year at Privilege, the World’s Biggest Club. Meganite is the full and complete representation of Mauro’s desires. It’s his people with his favorite DJs doing what they want to do, knowing it’s what the crowd wants too. This new compilation on the Big In Ibiza label represents just that, the music that makes Meganite, its DJs and Mauro Picotto so special.</p>
<p>Mauro Picotto presents Meganite Ibiza contains a live mix of exclusive cuts culled from Mauro's superb Alchemy label and a CD of mixes, remixes and new tracks from Mauro's illustrious career. Including the original mix of Iguana and a brand new remix of Lizard for 2008, two of the tracks which helped establish Mauro’s early career and propelled him onto the global dancefloor. This is where Mauro is in 2008 and as ever it’s on the cutting edge of electronic wizardry fused with pulsating infectious gyrating badass grooves.</p>
