<p>The one and only Respect party is back in New York with its nightclubbing festival ÉTÉ D’AMOUR, the Paris-meets-Ibiza celebration of the summer!</p>
<p>ÉTÉ D’AMOUR takes place every Thursday – from 26th of June to the 25th of September – in the club we all dream of: Santos Party House…with an incredible sound system, straight in the ears of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Doors open in the early evening for live shows &amp; label parties and the dance goes on late with the Respect twist of the artists: legendary American DJs, new French sensations and the fresh sounds of Europe.</p>
<p>On top of these 14 Thursdays, ÉTÉ D’AMOUR goes outdoor with three exclusive events including a boat party. Do you wanna cruise?</p>

ÉTÉ D’AMOUR est arrivé! The Summer of Love has arrived!</em></p>
<p>After a 7-year absence, the transatlantic Parisian Respect party returns to New York City. A long overdue comeback to the NYC nightlife landscape, Respect unites with Le Jean De and first-class promoters Made Event for a sizzling summer series. They say timing is everything and now with the premiere of Santos Party House, all the pieces are in place for NYC’s own ÉTÉ D’AMOUR.</p>
<p>Back in 1996, the Respect trio Jérôme Viger-Kohler, Fred Agostini &amp; David Blot met in Paris and hosted parties at the Queen with the best DJs from Paris touting the new, great French Tour Sound (Daft Punk, Dimitri, Motorbass). With Daft Punk kicking off the opening party, the Respect soirées lasted three years until it went on to conquer the world. From Paris, the Respect party went global; to Tokyo to Caracas, Kuala Lumpur to Sydney, Oslo to Miami, Cannes to Lisbon, with some famous residencies at Vega Copenhagen, Fuse Brussels and of course their legendary sessions at Twilo NYC, with partner in crime, Neil Aline. In 2002, Respect landed back in Paris on the Seine River for a series of boat parties that lasted four years. The music policy opened itself to all dance enthusiasts from Rock, Techno, Disco, Soul, Funk, Pop, Italo Disco, New Wave, P Funk and GoGo. Why not? Whatever, as long as it is fresh. Now the next chapter is to be written, with 14 weeks ahead to bring Respect back to New York City.</p>
<p>Santos Party House is a two-level, 8,000 sq. foot music venue, centrally located in downtown New York City, straddling Chinatown and Tribeca. Blurring the lines between music and art culture, the venue is designed to function as a concert hall, dance club, and lounge. The long-awaited space has been built from the ground up to make life as fun as possible and is now setting out to reclaim downtown’s nightlife.</p>
