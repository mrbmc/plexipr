<strong>Made Event presents<br />
PIG&amp;DAN/DAN DUNCAN<br />
(Cocoon Recordings)</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> is pleased to present the Dan Duncan of the highly-respected DJ/producer duo<strong> Pig&amp;Dan</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, December 12th</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In 1999, Pig&amp;Dan (Igor Tchkotoua &amp; Dan Duncan) met on a flight to Spain and began a partnership that has now risen to a point of recognition worldwide with their debut LP Imagine released on Cocoon Recordings late last year. Their mixture of influences has given them a sound, which is easily recognizable and seems to be loved by the masses.  After over twenty releases on their well-respected label Submission, Pig&amp;Dan moved towards minimal productions with their new label Sonic Society which is now being hailed as one of the "it" labels in the club scene, due in part to the support of Sven Väth, Loco Dice, M.A.N.D.Y. and Tiefschwarz.</p>
<p>After a fantastic summer and a highly successful South America tour in the fall, Pig&amp;Dan are set to release some new acoustic bombs on several labels.  Sven Väth just picked some of their brand new productions for a new release on Cocoon Recordings in early 2009.  Anthony Rother signed their track "Dreams of Bells", which will be released on his electro label Datapunk next month.  In addition, it will be featured on Rother's latest mix compilation "We Are Punks: Vol. 3" alongside Sven Väth and DJ Hell.  Lastly, John Dahlback's Pickadoll Records will release two vinyls, one in December 2008 and the second one immediately following in January 2009, both featuring two very strong peak time tracks.</p>
