<p style="text-align: justify;">Armin’s highly acclaimed productions include his most recent fourth artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mirage</strong></span>, for which he collaborated with the likes of BT, Ferry Corsten and Adam Young, and featured the hit track “Not Giving Up On Love” with Sophie Ellis-Bextor. His third artist album ‘Imagine’ was the first dance album to debut at number on the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart, and his second album ‘Shivers’ featured collaborations with Nadia Ali, Justine Suissa and Gabriel &amp; Dresden. Armin’s remix output includes tracks for the TV series ‘24’ and the likes of Motorcycle, The Killers, Faithless, BT and Kerli. Armin’s annual ‘<strong>A State of Trance’</strong> compilations have won several awards and continue to introduce trance fans to a fresh and exclusive selection of tracks, while his weekly 2-hour ‘A State of Trance’ radio show is listened to by 15 million electronic dance music lovers worldwide.
