<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Online dance and electronic music magazine <strong>Resident Advisor</strong> is proud to announce its inaugural New York City party. After years of debauchery and good times in Miami during WMC week, Resident Advisor has decided to spread our stateside party wings further a field and take on the Big Apple. For this special night, Resident Advisor presents two of their favorite DJs, deep house doyen <strong>Dixon</strong> and Kristian Beyer of <strong>Âme</strong>, to grace the decks at <strong>Cielo</strong>, along with Beat Pharmacy's <strong>Brendon Moeller</strong> on <em><strong>Thursday, November 13th</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For those of you who have already heard about Steffen "<strong>Dixon</strong>" Berkhahn, 3 words are generally associated with his name: DJ, House and Deep. Take them; mix them and shake'em, whatever option you take, the equation is there.  Dixon is for the last 10 years one of the more genuine and purest representatives of what is still called "house" music.  His latest release, "D.P.O.M.B. EP" was a joint project with both Âme and Henrik Schwarz and does not let down.<br />
<strong><br />
Âme</strong> are German duo Kristian Beyer &amp; Frank Wiedemann.  Inspired by the music of Stevie Wonder, West End Rec, Transmat, Weather Report and Herbie Hancock, they make Detroit-influenced deep house and music with soul. Recently Âme geared up to launch Fabric 42, and it's already being considered on of the best mix albums of the year.  On the highly regarded compilation, Âme create a kaleidoscopic blend of electronics and infectious grooves.  They have created their own soundscape here with an all-star cast, which breathes a magical soundtrack to the last days of summer and beyond.</p>
<p>Dixon and Âme have always followed their own musical path.  Innervisions, former sub-label of Sonar Kollektiv that was created by Dixon and Âme, was inspired by Dixon's residency at "Inner City" in Berlin.  Over the years, Innervisions has become the premier label for house heads everywhere thanks to era-defining club hits like Âme's "Rej" and the Dixon/Âme/Henrik Schwarz collaboration "Where We At?".</p>
<p>Alongside Dixon and Beyer, will be versatile NYC local <strong>Brendon Moeller</strong>, whose sets at Francois K's Deep Space night fit neatly into the deep house aesthetic.  With such innovators helming the decks, this Resident Advisor Night at Cielo will surely be a night not to be missed!</p>
