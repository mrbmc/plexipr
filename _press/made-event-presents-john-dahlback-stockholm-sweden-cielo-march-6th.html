JOHN DAHLBÄCK<br />
(Stockholm, Sweden)<br />
With Stel</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the next shining star out of Sweden’s electronic talent pool, <strong>John Dählback </strong>for his <strong>Cielo</strong> debut on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, March 6th, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Swedish electro chief <strong>John Dahlbäck</strong> is still in his early twenties, but he's had more releases than girlfriends with a singles discography edging ever closer to the hundred mark by the week. Even from an early age, John was learning the basics on his dad’s Atari computer and he soon established his own style, which blossomed into becoming one of the best young producers to date. Not soon after his initial success, he knew it was time to take the next step. Together with his cousin Jesper Dahlback, they produced under the moniker Hugg &amp; Pepp to huge acclaim and launched their own Pickadoll imprint, boasting top releases from Özgur Can, Sebastien Leger, Dada Life, Zoo Brazil, Robbie Rivera, Laidback Luke and Style of Eye. Recently John's remix for Ultra Records of JJ Flores "Stay" topped out at #1 on Beatport for 5 weeks!</p>
<p>After a string of successful LPs on Kompakt, Systematic, Pickadoll and Little Angel, his fifth studio album, Winners And Fools, is described by John as, “<em>the one I’m most proud of</em>.” He continues on, “<em>Making Winners And Fools I felt like it didn’t have to sound like anyone expected – it could be exactly what I wanted. I’ve always done quite dark albums in the past and this is really uplifting, with nice summer vibes and good vocal tracks</em>.” The album, billed as John Dahlbäck 's most commercial yet, in the vein of fellow Swede electro giants Eric Prydz and Steve Angello. John’s prolific nature continues to rule – his busy global touring schedule will be followed by work on another album, scheduled for release in summer 2009. For John, his agenda for making and playing music is simple. “<em>I’m quite calm when I DJ, I don’t want to be ‘showy’ - I love to play for dancing people, to really see them loving the tunes. And I love to make the tunes that get them dancing…”</p>
