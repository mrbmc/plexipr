<p>Coming off a wildly successful four-week summer Perfecto residency at Las Vegas’ Rain Nightclub in Palms Hotel and sold-out Electric Zoo festival gig, Germany’s <strong>ATB</strong> is already gearing up for another tour across the U.S. and Canada. His current single, “Could You Believe,” from his recently released mix compilation <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunset Beach DJ Session</strong></span>, has risen to #7 on Billboard’s Dance/Club Play Songs, proving that we just can’t get enough of André Tanneberger’s unique brand of electronic sounds and melodious club tracks.</p>
<p>The numbers don’t lie: 15,000 people came out to enjoy ATB’s dates at Rain, where he took over Paul Oakenfold’s <em><strong>Perfecto Vegas</strong></em> residency for four exclusive nights last month.<em> “I was really surprised when I got the offer for the summer residency at Perfecto Night,” </em>ATB says. <em>“It doesn’t happen too often that you get the chance to headline such a worldwide famous event series in a great city like Las Vegas. This was really an honor.”</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, ATB also graced the main stage at <strong><em>Electric Zoo</em></strong>, New York’s electronic music festival, where he played on the main stage to a sold-out 25,000-person crowd. Attendees unanimously agree that ATB created one of the most memorable moments of the festival when he unexpectedly dropped Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing In The Name Of”—and sang along to it!</p>
<p>And that’s classic ATB: spinning the unexpected and challenging the listener while delivering an expert mix of contemporary tunes and timeless classics. It establishes him as one of the leading DJs on a global scale, booked throughout the year at headline club nights and festivals all over the world. In fact, it’s the concept behind his next studio album, due out in early 2011. <em>“It’s searching for ideas, searching for creativity,”</em> ATB told Las Vegas Weekly.<em> “By being on the road I always get some inspiration from everywhere I am.” </em>Next stop: Phoenix!</p>
<p><em><strong>ATB <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunset Beach DJ Session</span></strong> is out now on Napith Music.</em></p>
