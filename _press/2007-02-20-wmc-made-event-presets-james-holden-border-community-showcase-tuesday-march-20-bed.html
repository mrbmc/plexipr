<p>Now in its 4th year, James Holden�s Border Community label continues to eschew boundaries of electronic music by tapping into the distinctive sounds of today�s producers and by creating a creative family. On his Border Community Showcase with Made Event, Holden says, <i>I\'m happy we\'re back again, it\'s an annual treat for us to be able to bring some of our label-family to do an intimate party in the US, and we couldn\'t ask for a better place (or soundsystem) for it.</i>  Together with techno queen Misstress Barbara and Swiss artist Mirko, they will fully test Integral Sound�s nuances to full effect to kick-off Winter Music Conference and the Made It Up series.</p>
<p>Over the years, Holden has evolved into a pioneer and visionary for his music. From his early trance prodigy days at Oxford, he has morphed into a serious artist and seeks to embrace the creativity in all. The artwork for his first unmixed artist album �Idiots Are Winning� was selected via a competition on the label�s website and the album contains loads of tools and different versions in order to inspire others. On his own approach to music-making, he says <i>What I want to do is make electronic music that feels more human and more live just letting the machines malfunction and me be barely in control of them.</i> He continues,</i>You just need to know where to inject the life into it, and how to, and then the computer can become an instrument just like any other. Computer music is naff really, unless it has that punk feel. Those dirty bits. That\'s what makes it human, and that\'s what I\'m focusing on now.</i></p>
<p>Misstress Barbara joins the Border Community with her first release �Barcelona� out now. After Miami, she will be releasing an EP entitled �Don�t Leave� (IT19) on her newly re-launched iturnem label. This year the label will not only be highlighting the best in electronic music, but up-and-coming producers as well. Barbara will also be headlining the Beatport.com stage at this year�s Detroit Electronic Music Festival with heavy touring in Europe, North America, and Asia throughout 2007.  Mirko aka Lazy Fat People unleashed micro-rave anthem �Big City� and edit heavy DJ weapon �Dark Water� on Border Community in 2006. With his music oriented to all new sorts of modern\' grooves between minimal, jacking and electro, Mirko is one of the shining stars of the Swiss electronic music scene.</p>
