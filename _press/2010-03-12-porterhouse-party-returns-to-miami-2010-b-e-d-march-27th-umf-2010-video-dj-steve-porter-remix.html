<p>Porterhouse returns to Miami during Winter Music Conference week for its 6th straight year on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 27th</strong></span> at intimate clubbing boîte B.E.D. DJ/producer Steve Porter first launched his inaugural assault on club denizens with his <strong>Porterhouse</strong> party at State nightclub back in 2005 – with an eclectic set made up of a combination of Big Room Electro, Techno and Progressive House with Break Beats for build-up that was so electrifying, he left the crowd clamoring for more of his infectious, signature style. Over the years, the Porterhouse parties were so successful that the critically acclaimed compilations ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Porterhouse Volumes I and II</strong></span>’ were spawned and his distinct ‘Porterhouse Style’ was unleashed to the world. Though he has had immense underground notoriety since then, 2009 was undoubtedly a defining year for Steve Porter as he made his mark on the mainstream front as a powerful music and Youtube video producer.</p>
<p>Porter has never been afraid to take his music one-step further in the name of keeping things intriguing. As he once fervidly said, “<em>I don’t make music for anybody, I make it for myself</em>.” It’s no surprise that he would use his creative foresight to experiment with the emerging ‘mash-up’ trend by creating the first ever video remix using the original Slap Chop infomercial to create a remix entitled <em>“Rap Chop</em>”. At almost 9 million Youtube views since its inception, the impressive viral Internet meme has propelled him into the spotlight. Popular is an understatement. Now at the pinnacle of his career, Steve Porter has composed so many video remixes that he not only has his own channel on Youtube now with over 16 million views but, he launched his own company Porterhouse Media to facilitate his new video remix projects which have garnered worldwide attention on press outlets such as <em>TMZ</em>, <em>Fox News </em>and <em>ESPN</em>. To date, his videos have been commissioned for <em>FedEx</em>, <em>IBM's Lotus Notes</em>, and most recently, he is handling projects for ABC and he is set to produce the entire <em>NBA</em> “Where Amazing Happens” ad campaign with his video remixes for the 2010 playoffs.</p>
<p>2010 will be the year of Porterhouse Media with heaps of exciting new video remixes in the works including: "Life Alert Remix” featuring Wilford Brimley, “Doc Bottoms Aspray Remix”, and two remixes for the hit TV shows "Scrubs" and “Entourage” where Porter will be remixing the opening track “Superhero” by<strong> Jane's Addiction</strong>.</p>
<p>On the touring front, Porter will be performing at upcoming massive events including <em>NBA</em>, <em>Ultra Music Festival</em> (March 26), <em>WMC</em>, and <em>Coachella</em>. For Ultra Music Festival, Porter created a special Ultra remix video starring many  of your favorite Ultra artists. At Coachella, Porter will debut a unique audio/visual live set full of original remixes as well as debut his “<em>Superhero</em>” remix collaboration with Jane's Addition's frontman Perry Farrell with an exclusive <em><strong>Perry Farrell vs. Steve Porter</strong></em> performance in the dance tent on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, April 16th</span>.</p>
<p>With Porter’s prolific output and keen pulse on the cultural pulse of new media, he is one of the few artists on the cutting edge of this brave, new world. Find out what’s everybody’s talking about on youtube and don’t miss the chance to catch the always exciting DJ stylings of Steve Porter at one of his upcoming shows.</p>
