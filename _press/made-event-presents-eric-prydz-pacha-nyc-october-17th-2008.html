w/ Sleepy &amp; Boo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the highly anticipated return of renowned Swedish DJ and producer <strong>ERIC PRYDZ</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October  17th, 2008</strong></span> along with Basic NYC DJs <strong>Sleepy&amp;Boo</strong>.</p>
<p>Eric Prydz propelled to fame after his 2004 hit single "Call on Me" topped the UK singles charts for five weeks and held the number one spot on the German Top100 for six consecutive weeks.  Now, Prydz has again reached the upper echelon of the UK charts, with his beautiful piano-led instrumental track 'Pjanoo' hitting the number two spot.  It was playlisted at Radio 1, Kiss, Capital and Galaxy over 2 months before release, and is currently one of the hottest singles of 2008.  The track has already received many acclamations including Pete Tong's Essential New Tune, Zane Lowe's Single of the Week, Record of the Week for Jo Whiley, and numerous others. He is also currently riding high on the Beatport Top 100 download chart with the #1, 5 and 7 spots respectively with "Rakfunk", "Wakanpi", and "Evouh" on Pryda Recordings.</p>
<p>Eric Prydz is on a roll at the moment with his labels Mouseville, Pryda Recordings and Pryda Friends positively brimming with underground club hits.  Pryda Recordings recently such saw the release of Pryda 012, a unique release as it is the first time the label has released three tracks on any format: "Evouh", "Wakanpi" and "Rakfunk".  In addition, Mouseville's Mouse 009 is set for release on October 13th, again another unique release as it is the first time an artist other than Cirez D has been released by the label.  Mouse 009 features the track "Ron Hardy Said" by Paolo Mojo &amp; Jim Rivers.</p>
<p>Eric is now in charge of three highly respected labels whose releases are in feverish demand, consistently selling huge quantities of vinyl which is truly incredible in the markets current climate. The labels are arguably proving to be the most successful and forward thinking imprints currently existing. Each label was strictly developed to give Eric a platform to release his own productions without outside interference, simply his music on his terms. It was important for Eric to step back after his previous successes and release music without schedules and pressure. Ultimately he wanted to control his own image and destiny, something extremely important to him and his career. The ethos behind the labels was truly underground, scarcely any promotion, no press intrusion and true label design/identity... a formula which has proven massively successful.</p>
