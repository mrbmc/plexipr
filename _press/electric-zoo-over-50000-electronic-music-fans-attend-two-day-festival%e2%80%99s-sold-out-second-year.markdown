<p>At <strong>Electric Zoo</strong> 2010 over Labor Day weekend, over 50,000 music lovers and over 70 of the world’s best DJs and artists chased Hurricane Earl out of Randall’s Island Park in New York City for two sold-out days. Cool breezes and hot beats were as abundant as electronic music styles, including techno, trance, house, dubstep, electro and more, from artists like <strong>The Chemical Brothers</strong>, <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong>, <strong>Axwell</strong>, <strong>Bassnectar</strong>, <strong>Moby</strong>, <strong>Major Lazer</strong>, <strong>Pretty Lights</strong> and <strong>Richie Hawtin</strong>. Not to mention the variety of food choices—from Miss Softee's specialty "electric cone," ice cream topped with Pop Rocks to Pizza Moto's wood-fired pizza—which all came together as a true celebration of the today’s global dance music culture and a raging success for the festival’s second year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"We are thrilled with the overwhelming turn-out for our second year. We view it as a testament to the growing popularity of electronic music in America and the fact that we all just want to hear a good beat.  The enthusiasm of the crowd was truly inspiring to us. Thanks to everyone for coming out to dance - we are already looking forward to EZ 2011!"</em><br />
<strong>- Laura De Palma &amp; Mike Bindra, Electric Zoo Executive Producers</strong></p>

<p>This year, Electric Zoo added even more to the festival’s visual art experience, inviting renowned artists <strong>Chor Boogie</strong>, <strong>Mr. Maxx Moses</strong>, <strong>Doze Green</strong>, <strong>Cern</strong>, <strong>Cekis</strong>, and <strong>Brent Nolasco</strong> to showcase their diverse styles and collaborate together by painting the Sunday School Grove buses. One bus will be donated to <em>NYC Arts Cypher</em>, a non-profit organization committed to promoting positive values through arts and entertainment programs, projects and events among at risk youth, to be used as a mobile art workshop/multimedia lab. The other bus will be returning to Electric Zoo next year!</p>

<p><em>"America's Biggest Dance Parties: Electric Zoo Festival"</em> <strong><em>—Rolling Stone</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“In a musical zone that diligently parses itself into subgenres, the festival’s 67 acts added up to both a dance marathon and a broad-spectrum survey, from crowd-pleasing trance and relentless techno to abstract minimal house. In the three tents and on an outdoor main stage... every style put bodies in motion.” </em> <strong>— Jon Pareles,</strong> <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong></p>
<p><em>"Electric Zoo went down in a big way over Labor Day weekend on Randall’s Island in New York City. Complete with an all-star lineup, four stages, perfect weather, and two days of sold-out 25,000+ person crowds, the festival was nothing less than epic."</em> <strong><em>—Frank151</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“[The Chemical Brothers] was a phenomenal close to a gorgeous day, filled with extraordinary talent, exhilarating consumption, and exhausting dance moves.”</em> <em><strong>— BlackBook Magazine</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“New York is one of the best markets for electronic music and there are a lot of fans. New York finally has the [Electronic Dance Music] festival it deserves.”</em> <strong>— Armin van Buuren</strong></p>
<p><em>"The last time I'd played Randall's Island was Lollapalooza in 1995, and Electric Zoo was bigger! The production was great, and the audience was amazing!"</em> <strong>—Moby</strong></p>
<p><em>"Electric Zoo was amazing! New York definitely brought the energy!"</em> <strong>—Laidback Luke</strong></p>
<p><em>"EZ was amazing this year!  The production was a lot more intense and the crowds were ready for it - the energy was through the roof.  It makes me happy to see everyone so excited about EDM in NYC again...the way it should be.  This is the best festival on the East Coast and it is only its 2nd year!"</em> <strong>—Kaskade</strong></p>
<p><em>"I loved playing Electric Zoo! The crowd looked like they were having the time of their life."</em> <strong>—A-Trak</strong></p>
<p><em>"Electric Zoo just raised its bar up notches from last year. Sold out crowd for NYC and the people were having it all the way to the end. Amazing festival and lineup."</em> <strong>—Steve Aoki</strong></p>
