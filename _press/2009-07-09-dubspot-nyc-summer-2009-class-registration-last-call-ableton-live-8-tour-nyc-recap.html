<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DubSpot</strong>, New York City's home for dynamic electronic music production and DJ education, celebrated its <strong>2 Year anniversary </strong>with a long weekend June 25th-28th.  In addition to hosting three individual birthday parties, DubSpot also brought its <em><strong>Live 8 U.S. Sessions Tour</strong></em> in for its home stop, with <strong>Ableton Live 8</strong> production and performance workshops.  An abundance of high profile artists were involved throughout the events, and the weekend has received enthusiastic praise from all participants not only for its ingenuity, but also its originality and<img class="size-full wp-image-1624 alignright" title="Richie Hawtin" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Tour_NYC_Photos_RichieHawtin.jpg" alt="Richie Hawtin" width="275" height="206" /> high standard of quality.  Full workshop videos with techno auteurs <strong>Richie Hawtin</strong> &amp; <strong>Ambivalent</strong>, Dub pioneer <strong>Scientist</strong>, <strong>Peter Kirn</strong> of <a href="http://www.CreateDigitalMusic.com ">CreateDigitalMusic.com </a>and much more to be made available online soon.  Check out the DubSpot blog <a href="http://dubspot.squarespace.com/">here</a> for updates.</p>
<p>The first of DubSpot's 2 Year Anniversary parties was the <a href="http://www.funkaid.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Funk Aid for Africa</strong></span></a> NYC release party.  The album, and the fundraising effort in general, had been riding high already from a 4 star <a href="http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/clubs/75752/various-artists-funk-aid-for-africa-music-review">review</a> from <em>Time Out New York</em>, and DJ sets from<strong> OBaH</strong>, <strong>Reborn</strong> and <strong>Ticklah</strong> carried the party late into the night. The second of DubSpot's 2 Year Anniversary Parties was held at Love, and saw <em>Minus</em>' <strong>Richie Hawtin</strong> take to the decks for a special 4-hour set.  Hawtin set the place ablaze in an all too rare club appearance in New York.  Working with our partner, NYC techno promoters  <em>Blk|Market Membership</em>, DubSpot packed the house with instructors, students and friends, and danced until dawn to the banging beats of world-class techno. Sunday night's<em><strong> Hi-Fidelity DubSpot Sessions</strong></em> kept the momentum going late, as <strong>Scientist</strong> mixed <em><strong>Dub Is A Weapon</strong></em> live, plus sets from <strong>Badawi</strong>, <strong>DJ Kiva</strong>, <strong>Matt Shadetek</strong>, and <strong>DJ Rupture</strong>.  The show was widely enjoyed and appreciated as a world-class night of music and community.</p>
