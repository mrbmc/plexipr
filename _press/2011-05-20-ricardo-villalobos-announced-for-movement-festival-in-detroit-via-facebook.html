<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Secret Artist’ placeholder on the Movement Electronic Music Festival schedule was announced via the festival’s official Facebook page at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The post said: <em>“Ricardo Villalobos is the ‘Secret Artist.’  He WILL be in Detroit to perform at MOVEMENT May 29<sup>th</sup> and at the Voyage Royale: I’m on a Boat 3 afterparty. Check</em> <a href="http://t.ymlp179.net/usjmjanawesagamymataqeuh/click.php" target="_blank"><em>www.Movement.us</em></a> <em>for more info.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em>Villalobos, a world-renowned microhouse and minimal techno DJ/producer, last performed in Detroit in 2002 when he played live at Paxahau Electronic Music Festival (PEMF), a four-day party that was held at the former Panacea Nightclub in downtown Detroit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paxahau originally released the Artist Set Schedule on May 12, but in the Sunday, May 29 vitaminwater stage slot inserted ‘Secret Artist’ as a placeholder, which created a lot of buzz and speculation in social media spaces since then—and is the reason festival organizers decided to release Villalobos’ scheduled performances via the festival’s official Facebook page.</p>
