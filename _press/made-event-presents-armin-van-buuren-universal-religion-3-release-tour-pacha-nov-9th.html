<p style="text-align: left">Dutch DJ/Producer ARMIN VAN BUUREN received the yearly award for the #1 most popular global DJ in 2007 from the well known British magazine DJ MAG. In the influential yearly top 100, a record-breaking 345,000 votes were cast by dance music fans from more than 220 countries.</p>
<p>Armin has been listed in the DJ Mag Top 100 since 2001. In 2002 he entered the top at the 5th position, after which he climbed even further to the 3rd place. After holding this position for 3 years in a row he climbed up to the 2nd place last year. This year he was able to takeover the No.1 DJ crown from Paul van Dyk and past three year consecutive winner Tiësto.</p>
<p>Now Armin is in the midst of a major US tour for his upcoming mix compilation Universal Religion 2008: Live from Armada at Ibiza releasing on Ultra Records December 4th. The album was recorded live on August 21 in summer 2007, during the Armada night at legendary Amnesia nightclub. On the live element Armin says, "It adds to the feeling, the experience, so you can feel like you're there, having a great time with your friends." The unplanned set list became the perfect CD release: a spontaneous selection of records that embodies the timeless Balearic sound of Ibiza against the buzz of a crowd enjoying a world-renowned club and their favorite DJ. "I had the first two tracks lined up, and the rest I just chose as I played, gauged on the reaction from the dancefloor," says Armin. "Tracks like Big Sky, Sunlounger and Daydream are pure Balearic gems. It's scary to record something live but once the music starts flowing you lose yourself to it".</p>
<p>On top of his already vigorous schedule with another Ultra release, A State of Trance 2007, earlier this year, Armin continues to host his hugely popular international radio show "A State of Trance" which is broadcast across 40 FM stations in 20 countries and heard by 2.5 million people every week. . For the third time, the show received an award for Best Global Dance Radio Show during Winter Music Conference in Miami.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Armin has been working in the studio for his upcoming artist album which is scheduled for release in early 2008. To support this new album, Armin will tour the globe with a new show around the "Armin Only" concept, in which he plays long sets, supported by several live acts and performances. The success of the two previous editions in the Netherlands, laid the foundation for a worldwide tour in 2008. The kick-off is planned on the April 19th, 2008 in De Jaarbeurs in Utrecht, the Netherlands, which marks the start of the global tour.</p>
