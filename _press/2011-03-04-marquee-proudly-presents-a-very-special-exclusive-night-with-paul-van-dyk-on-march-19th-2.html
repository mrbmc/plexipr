<p><strong>Paul van Dyk</strong> is commanding the decks for a very special exclusive night at <strong>Marquee Las Vegas </strong>on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 19th, 2011</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Since its January unveiling, Marquee Las Vegas has proven itself be the number one destination for the world’s premier electronic music talent. So it’s only natural that Grammy-nominated and internationally acclaimed DJ/producer <strong>Paul van Dyk</strong> (known to his many fans as “PvD”) will be front and center on its spectacular stage. The revolutionary club complete with a 40-foot LED DJ booth, state-of-the-art custom sound system with 32,000-watt subwoofers, is the perfect backdrop for this groundbreaking artist. For the exclusive one-off event, PvD will be performing with a custom production rig with special lighting and custom visuals. He will also be previewing material from his highly anticipated brand new upcoming artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVOLUTION</span>, which is due out later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Paul van Dyk</strong> has dominated the electronic music scene since the early 1990s. The Berlin-based artist has twice been ranked as the world’s #1 DJ by DJ Magazine, sold over 3.5 million albums worldwide, and travels around the world over 16 times each year to perform sold-out shows. He is currently nominated for International Dance Music Awards for Best Global DJ and Best European DJ (both of which he has won in previous years) as well as Best Podcast for “VONYC Sessions,” his weekly electronic dance music radio show which has been running for more than six years. ‘VONYC Sessions 2010,’ the second compilation in a series featuring the radio show’s stand-out tracks of the year, is currently dominating the EDM charts. PvD also celebrates his musical achievements with ‘Volume,’ the 2009 album of his best works to date -- encompassing his #1 hit single “Home” and selections from his massive  15-year catalog,  including works from his studio albums ‘45 RPM’ (1994),  ‘Seven Ways’ (1996),  ‘Out There And Back’ (2000),  the Grammy-nominated ‘Reflections’ (2003) and ‘In Between’ (2007).</p>
