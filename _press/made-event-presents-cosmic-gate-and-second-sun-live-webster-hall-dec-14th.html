<p>Made Event presents German trancers Cosmic Gate and Miami-based upstarts Second Sun (Live) at Webster Hall – Friday, December 14th, 2007.</p>
<p>Cosmic Gate are Claus Terhoeven and Stefan Bossems, aka Nic Chagall and DJ Bossi. After the highly successful artist album 'Earth Mover', the duo are back with the third volume in their mix series 'Back 2 Back 3' – the new double-mix CD out now on Tiësto’s label Black Hole Recordings. The album includes the finest sounds of Trance, Progressive and Tech-Electro, including numerous unreleased productions and edits especially made for this double-CD. In total more than 150 minutes enthusiastic and unique audio impressions by Cosmic Gate. Some highlights on this CD include brand new tracks from Above &amp; Beyond, Markus Schulz, D. Ramirez &amp; Mark Knight, Johan Gielen, First State and the new Cosmic Gate single “Body Of Conflict feat. Denise Rivera”, along with an exclusive Cosmic Gate remix of Tiësto’s single “Everything Feat Jes” and an exclusive B2B3 Reconstruction mix of the Cosmic Gate classic-tune “Fire Wire”.</p>

Recently dubbed by URB magazine as "clubland's newest superstars," the band first emerged on the trance scene with their hit collaboration with Paul Van Dyk, "CRUSH". After another three singles on his label Vandit ("Empire", "The Spell" and "Playground") helped solidify their rep, with spins from the worlds top DJs and spots on countless compilations, they descended upon the house music scene with another major splash. During Miami's WMC 2006, their remix of Queen's "Another one Bites the Dust" (Positiva/EMI Records) became a party anthem and then, Antoine’s vocals on Sharam's "Party All The Time", became one of the biggest dance hits of the year. They also did a remix of the track, which was played on Pete Tong's "Essential Selection" Radio 1 show a mere 24 hours after its completion. Subsequent remixes for Sander Kleinenberg "This is not Miami", Shapeshifters "Sensitivity" and Seamus Haji "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life" also ended up in the crates of the world's leading house DJs. The duo will be performing live as a four-piece band in the new year and is currently in talks with various labels for their forthcoming full-length debut album due out March 2008.</p>
