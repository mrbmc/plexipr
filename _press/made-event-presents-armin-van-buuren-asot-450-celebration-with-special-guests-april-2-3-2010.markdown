<p><em><strong>Made Event </strong></em>is proud to present a two day ‘<strong>A State of Trance 450</strong>’ celebration with the world’s #1 DJ <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> and some very special guests at <strong>Roseland Ballroom</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday and Saturday, April 2 &amp; 3, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> has provided New York audiences with some of its most cherished events of the ‘00s.  As the Dutchman’s popularity grew to seemingly unreachable heights, the scale of his performances followed.  During the early part of the decade, New York saw Armin perform at some of its most elite clubs like Spirit, Crobar, and Pacha NYC.   However, as the Armin van Buuren brand grew, there would be few city venues’ that could contain him.  Soon Armin took his DJ set out of the clubs and into large-scale venues like Brooklyn’s Tobacco Warehouse, McCarren Pool, the massive indoor space of Roseland Ballroom, Governor's Island and, of course, the headlining set of the first night of the inaugural Electric Zoo festival in 2009.  Now Armin returns to Roseland Ballroom armed with a collection of his finest tunes, a stellar two-day lineup of DJ’s, and top notch production, stellar visuals &amp; extraordinary sound provided by <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Armin van Buuren’s radio show ‘<em><strong>A State of Trance</strong></em>’ has been going strong for the better part of a decade. With an estimated 10 million listeners on local, internet and satellite radio stations around the world, ‘A State of Trance’ is one of dance music’s most popular radio programs, garnering multiple accolades throughout its historic run.  The show’s weekly blend of new tunes, future favorites and classic tracks remains the perfect place for trance fans to keep close track of the music they love.</p>
<p>In 2009 ‘<em>A State of Trance</em>’ celebrated its 400th broadcast with an unforgettable series of events. A 72-hour non-stop radio broadcast from clubs in Germany, U.K. and The Netherlands featuring over 60 DJs.  With ‘<em><strong>A State of Trance 450</strong></em>’ Armin van Buuren is set to go bigger and bolder than ever before as he and some special guests travel to 2 continents, 4 countries and 5 clubs in celebration of the show’s 450th episode. The celebration kicks off in Toronto then journeys to New York City for two huge dates before returning to Europe for events in Slovakia and Poland.</p>
