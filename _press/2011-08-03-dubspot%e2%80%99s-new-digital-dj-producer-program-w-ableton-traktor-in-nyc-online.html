<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dubspot</strong> is always pushing the envelope of possibilities when it comes to teaching their students. The evolution of technology is at the core of Dubspot’s programs, which train students to use software and hardware that is changing the future of music performance. They’re excited to announce that the renowned NY institution is now offering its first ever <strong>Online</strong> <strong>Digital</strong> <strong>DJ/<wbr>Producer Programs</wbr></strong>. With an Internet connection and a few key pieces of software it is now possible to learn how to DJ and produce music from the comfort of your own home. This marks a massive shift in possibilities for the school, which previously offered these courses only as part of the NYC in-house curriculum. <strong>Dubspot Online</strong> now offers a comprehensive education that mirrors the intimate classroom experience that Dubspot has developed and become renowned for.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital technology continues to blur the lines between DJing and music production. The increasing interconnectivity between the two essential components of a musician’s abilities demands a new form of education adapted to these shifts. Dubspot’s cutting-edge, artist-developed Digital DJ / Producer Programs address these needs with a series of courses that teach you to DJ using Traktor Pro 2, while at the same time giving you insight on how to create music with Ableton Live. The combination builds a foundation for creative success, and teaches methods of blending both art forms for a strategic attack on music performance. These courses have been handcrafted by some of the sharpest minds in the music industry, and keep students aligned with the latest in creative technology.</p>
