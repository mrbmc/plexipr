<p style="text-align: left;">The young French phenom may have skipped high school, but has already made a career for himself as one of France’s biggest rising stars. <em><strong>Pacha NYC </strong></em>proudly presents <strong>Surkin</strong> on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Friday May 1st, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As a former four-to-the-floor hater, <strong>Surkin</strong> got into dance music through Detroit ghetto-tech and thanks to the internet, as he started to dig deeper into club music history focusing on Miami Bass, Chicago ghetto and non-house music. Add a thick layer of glammed-up filtered house courtesy of French dons Daft Punk and local originators Jess &amp; Crabbe and you’ve got the full Surkin mille-feuilles.</p>
<p>In May 2006, Parisian label Institubes released two Surkin records at once, “Ghetto Obsession” and “Radio Fireworks” which garnered a tremendous response, and was played and playlisted by everybody from the Ed Banger and Erol Alkan cabal to Boys Noize and Tiga. Those tracks even managed to break the indie dance glass ceiling by smashing main rooms all over the globe. Radio Fireworks emerged as a genuine club hit, topping both Justice’s AND Mylo’s “Best tracks of 2006” lists. With his first album due out in October, Surkin is still riding high of his latest EP, “Next of Kin” featuring a huge fuck-the-zeitgeist hit, “White Knight Two”, that just made Mixmag’s top 100 tracks list of 2008. Pacha NYC together with Surkin will be exploring a whole new genre of dance music that is growing ever so quickly.</p>
<p>Supporting Surkin on this night are DJ’s from a trio of respected NYC dance music organizations.  JDH &amp; Dave P have been at the helm of their popular New York City-based FIXED for nearly five year and have been responsible for bringing some of the largest names in dance music to US shores for their debut gigs, including Justice, The Klaxons, Simian Mobile Disco, and Soulwax.  Star Eyes &amp; The Captain from Brooklyn-based Trouble &amp; Bass will also be bringing their signature style of bass heavy house music to the booming Pacha soundsystem.  Michael Meds represents another fine NYC dance music institution Ruff Club.  Having recently celebrated their three year anniversary, Ruff Club has carved their place in the city as a premier Friday night destination for the dirtiest in electro and house. Also just added, Dances With White Girls, DJ Ayres, and S$mall C$hange round out the all-star NYC support.</p>
