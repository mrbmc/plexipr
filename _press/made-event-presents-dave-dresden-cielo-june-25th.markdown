DAVE DRESDEN<br />
with Zach Roth<br />
<em>@ Cielo</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the return of dance music Renaissance man<strong> Dave Dresden</strong> to <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 25th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> has had his hands full in all aspects of the dance music industry.  Starting as a music journalist and radio host, Dresden was an instrumental figure in introducing some of dance music’s biggest names to American audiences during the 1990’s.  Now known as a DJ/Remixer/Producer/Collaborator extraordinaire, Dresden has recently formed his second trailblazing collaborative project.  Responsible for some of the biggest and most recognizable club hits of the last decade, Dave Dresden continues to show the passion for music which brought him to the apex of the industry.</p>
<p>In 2001 Dresden partnered with Josh Gabriel and formed the DJ/production duo, Gabriel &amp; Dresden. Shortly after, the duo gained international recognition by way of their remix work on tracks from Tiesto, Way Out West, and Above &amp; Beyond, as well as more pop influenced tracks from Dido and Jewel. During the duo’s time together they amassed 18 #1 positioned singles and remixes on Billboard's Club Play Chart including the worldwide smash "As the Rush Comes".  By 2007 the duo was recognized by the IDMA’s as Best U.S DJs, and then again the following year.</p>
<p>As a solo artist, Dresden's exhibited the same determination he possessed during the early stages of his career and has successfully remixed work from a wide spectrum of artists from The Killers, Annie Lennox and Sarah McLachlan to Paul Oakenfold, Madonna, and Radiohead.  Now, he has a new collaboration with former Mephisto Odyssey frontman Mikael Johnston.  Already releasing several successful remixes for the likes of Lily Allen, BT, and Crystal Method - <em><strong>Dresden &amp; Johnston</strong></em> are now hard at work on their first full length album.  Their club smash single “Keep Faith” has been steadily climbing the Beatport charts and they are set to release their latest double A side “The Cove / Redhead” on their own <em>Problem Child Rekords</em>, inspired by Rick O'Berry's moving dolphin conservation documentary - <em>The Cove</em>.  In addition, their work with vocal powerhouse Nadia Ali has been generating serious buzz with inclusions on upcoming compilations from Armin van Buuren and Menno de Jong.  The duo is also set to unveil a new live show incorporating elements of DJing, remixing, and live instrumentation in support of their new material.</p>
