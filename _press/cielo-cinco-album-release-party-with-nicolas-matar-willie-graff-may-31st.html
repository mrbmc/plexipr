<p style="text-align: center" align="center"><strong>Cielo ‘Cinco' Album Release Party<br />
'Cinco' Mixed By Nicolas Matar &amp; Willie Graff (Tommy Boy)</strong></p>
<p align="left">Cielo celebrates the release of its 5 year compilation album <strong>CINCO</strong>, with an album release party on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, May 31st</strong></span> with resident DJs Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff. The release party is in advance of the album's release date on Tommy Boy on July 8th and Graff's annual pilgrimage to Ibiza for his summer residency.</p>
<p><strong>CINCO </strong>is an eclectic amalgam of styles incorporating deep house, techno embellishments, and soulful vibes. The album begins in classic style with Carl Craig's C2 remix of pianist Francesco Tristano's "The Melody" and features a selection of tracks with a Spanish homegrown flair from longtime Ibiza cohort DJ Pippi and Willie Graff, as well as legendary Spaniards Kiko Navarro and Cesar De Melero. Also included are the latest tracks from Tommy Boy artists Ultra Naté and Louie Vega, three stunning remixes from Charles Webster, and contributions from dub-techno duo Swayzak, Billboard #1 Hot Dance Club Play artist Joi Cardell, NYC Small Wonder DJ/producer Alix Alvarez, owner of Toronto's acclaimed DNH Records Nick Holder for NRK, keyboardist Eric Kupper as K-Scope, Osunlade as Nomumbah, and deep soulful house artist Halo Varga amongst the talented collection.</p>
<p>The duo of Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff artfully combine their common musical bearings and experienced DJ styles across the Cielo compilation series.  Matar has developed his eclectic sound by playing in the most celebrated nightclubs in the world over the past fifteen years.  His skillful DJ'ing combines elements of jazz, deep house, techno and African and Latin influences. Matar eventually opened Cielo in 2003 in order to create a spiritual and musical counterpart to the best of clubbing he had witnessed globally. He brought in resident DJ, Willie Graff, who is known for spinning an array of house music genres while incorporating a deep, moody and minimal style.  Graff performs at the hottest clubs around the globe and is also the world renowned Pacha Ibiza's resident DJ during the summer season.</p>
<p>For those who've never ventured inside the retro-futuristic club and housed it up on the sunken dance-floor - mind and body lifted by its crisp, pure, heavenly sound - the Cielo compilation series transports you to Cielo for the perfect night of clubbing. For the faithful, it will expand horizons. Widely recognized as the ‘Best Club' in North America by The Club World Awards (winner in 2008, 2006 &amp; 2005) and top-ranked annually in DJ Mag's Top Clubs of the World, Cielo and the unprecedented success of the compilation series, has amassed a worldwide audience and appeals to the more mature and seasoned dance music aficionados. The ongoing success of the series is a testament to the distinctive style of programming at Cielo, which celebrates top quality music above all else.</p>
