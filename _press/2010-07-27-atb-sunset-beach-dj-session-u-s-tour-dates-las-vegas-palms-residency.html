<p style="text-align: left;">A brief glance at <strong>ATB</strong>’s touring schedule for the summer season reveals him clocking up the air miles as he graces the world’s finest clubs and stages from Gatecrasher in Jakarta, Indonesia, to the Electric Zoo festival on Randall’s Island in New York City. Events such as the Cafe Del Rio festival in Budapest, Hungary and the Baltic Beach festival in Liepaja, on the coast of Latvia, set the tone for the summer: a celebration of sound, sun and sand. Welcome to ATB’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunset Beach DJ Session</strong></span>.</p>
<p>With eight successful studio albums under his belt, André Tanneberger has long since proved his talent as an artist. Yet he is so much more than a mere producer and songwriter. Outside the studio, ATB has also established himself as one of the leading DJs on a global scale, booked throughout the year at headline club nights and events all over the world.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunset Beach DJ Session</span> sees André embarking on a new artistic journey along the compilation trail. Part 1 showcases an exquisite selection of brand new club tracks, blended into a superlative ATB DJ set. Part 2, meanwhile, introduces ATB in beach lounge mode, serving up a fantastic mix of contemporary tunes and timeless classics. Once again, André demonstrates his knack of hitting the perfect combination of tracks across the genre as his mix skills come to the fore.  Even better, there’s a special treat for ATB fans in store, with three exclusive new ATB songs and the new single “<em>Could You Believe</em>”.</p>
<p>As the sun sets beyond the sea, enjoy a truly refreshing experience from one of the biggest names on the international dance music scene.</p>
