<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
Halloween Bash<br />
Above &amp; Beyond<br />
+ Fedde Le Grand</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong><strong>@ Roseland Ballroom<br />
with Zack Roth<br />
Come dressed in your best Halloween attire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a Halloween that is sure to go down in history, <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents UK superstar trance DJs <strong>Above &amp; Beyond </strong>and Dutch phenomenon <strong>Fedde Le Grand</strong> together for one night of ghoulish mayhem at the <strong>Roseland Ballroom</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, October 31st, 2009</strong></span>. In addition to the Halloween festivities, the occasion also serves as a celebration of the release of Above &amp; Beyond’s latest compilation album <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anjunabeats Volume 7</strong></span> and Fedde Le Grand’s sublime debut artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Output</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anjunabeats Volume 7</strong></span> showcases the best new music from Above &amp; Beyond’s <em><strong>Anjunabeats</strong></em> imprint, widely regarded as the world’s premier trance and progressive house label. Through Above &amp; Beyond’s emphasis on forward-thinking established artists and nurturing the hottest new talent, Anjunabeats has cemented a fine reputation as a ‘go-to’ staple for those seeking innovative dance music. As the album series hits Volume 7, Anjunabeats’ success is more evident than ever, with an artist roll call that offers up the very best (and the very latest) quality trance and progressive across 2 CDs. Included as a bonus disc in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anjunabeats Volume 7</span> is Above &amp; Beyond’s new DVD, ‘A Dog With A Smile’. An off-the-wall look at life on tour with the trio, the DVD features interviews, live sets, and behind the scenes footage from on the road with the UK’s most popular DJs. The trailer for ‘A Dog With A Smile’ is currently available for viewing through YouTube.</p>
<p>Joining Above &amp; Beyond on this hallowed night is rising Dutch dynamo DJ <strong>Fedde Le Grand</strong>, as he returns to the Big Apple with his blistering hot presence. Currently riding high on the international success of his unique, sublime and cutting edge debut artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Output,</strong></span> Fedde's return to NYC is feverishly anticipated among the city's music elite and thousands of Fedde-fans. The album included collaborations with the likes of Will.i.am, Mr V, Rob Birch (Stereo MCs), Ida Corr, Mitch Crown, Camille Jones and more, and is a 13-track sonic masterpiece from the young Dutch master. A true body of artistic expression, Output has been crafted by someone born to make music, perform and to entertain, and proves without doubt that Fedde is an artist with no musical boundaries.</p>
