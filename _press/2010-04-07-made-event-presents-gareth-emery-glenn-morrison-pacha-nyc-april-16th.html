They are joined by one of NYC's rising talents <strong>Zack Roth</strong> and London's brightest upcoming progressive, tech-house producer <strong>Ad Brown</strong>.</p>
<p>Get familiar with <strong>Gareth Emery</strong>, the man who has been changing the face of electronic and trance music ever since he exploded onto the scene just a few short years ago. In limited time, he has already established himself amongst the class of DJ elite. 2009 was a banner year for Emery as he spent more time at the top of <em>Beatport</em>’s trance chart than any other artist, was nominated for the ‘Best Podcast’ for the third consecutive year at the <em>IDMA</em>’s, and cracked top 10 of the coveted <em>DJ Mag Top 100</em> poll (reaching number 9).  His<a href="http://www.garethemerypodcast.com/"> <strong>Gareth Emery Podcast</strong></a> is one of the most influential dance music podcasts in existence, having recently celebrated its fourth year running and 100th episode. In addition, Emery has recently launched his label, <em><strong>Garuda</strong></em> which is already responsible for numerous chart-topping releases and sold out club nights around the world. In between his hectic touring schedule which takes him to the world’s finest events and clubs, 2010 see’s Emery hard at work on his anticipated artist album as well as an exclusive promotional track for one of the world's leading dance festivals,<em> Global Gathering</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn Morrisson</strong> is a DJ, remixer, label owner and one of those rare producers who’s deep passion for music can be felt permeating throughout his eclectic sound. He has released a slew of notable dance records through his acclaimed label <em>Morrison Recordings</em>, representing some of the most forward-thinking music in the industry.  The most recent releases off the label are his EPs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odyssey</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grafitti/You Plus Me Equals This</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drone</span>, which have all received extensive plays from DJ heavyweights like John Digweed, Sasha, and Sander Kleinenberg.  Morrison continues to pack out clubs in more places across the world than ever before, including a quarterly residency with <em>Perfecto</em> in Las Vegas.  He has quickly gained a reputation for demolishing the dancefloors of elite venues around the world with his signature style of melodic trance and energetic house.  Whether it is playing exclusive private parties or huge stadium events, the name Glenn Morrison is synonymous with good times and good tunes.</p>
