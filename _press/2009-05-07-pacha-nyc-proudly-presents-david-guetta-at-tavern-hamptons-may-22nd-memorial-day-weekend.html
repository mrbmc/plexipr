<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> is setting sail to the Hamptons this summer with none other than French Superstar <strong>DAVID GUETTA </strong>manning the decks at <strong>Tavern</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 22nd</strong></span> to kick off the Memorial day weekend and summer 2009.</p>
<p>At his last event at <em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> in April, <strong>DAVID GUETTA </strong>simply delivered an eye shocking, jaw dropping show. To see Guetta take control of a dancefloor is something special. A direct connection with the crowd, driving hands in the air as he works CDJs, EQs and effect, Guetta creates moments. Fans singing along to his hit records, it creates a vibe that leaves people remember a night filled with happy smiles and dancing hearts.</p>
<p>DAVID GUETTA is a name synonymous with the world’s greatest house and dance music, and with the DJ sets and parties that bring that music to life. Since releasing his first pioneering house single in 1992, David Guetta has sold over 2 million albums worldwide and over 3.2 million singles. He has been France’s No. 1 club DJ for a decade, and was named the world’s No. 1 House DJ in 2008. DAVID GUETTA has teamed with the internationally revered Pop/R&amp;B goddess and Grammy winner KELLY ROWLAND for Guetta’s new single, “When Love Takes Over,” released digitally as a single track on April 28 2009.</p>
<p>With three chart-topping albums to date (Just a Little More Love, 2002; Guetta Blaster, 2004; Pop Life, 2007), EMI Music will release Guetta’s much-awaited 4th album in June 2009 in France and in September 2009 internationally. Guetta and his wife Cathy are also famed for staging the mega-sized dance parties, F*** Me I’m Famous, for tens of thousands of fans from Ibiza to Miami, New York, London, Barcelona and Paris. They have released four club compilation packages with the same name.</p>
<p>A summer extravaganza with the Club World Awards “<em>Best Superclub</em>” Pacha New York in the Hamptons surely will make this year’s Memorial Day kick off event a special and memorable night not to be missed!</p>
