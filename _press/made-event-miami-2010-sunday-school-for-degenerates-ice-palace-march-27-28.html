<p><strong>Sunday School For Degenerates</strong> will once again descend upon Miami to mark the end of conference week in grand fashion.  Now in its fifth installment, the 24 hour party extravaganza has become a virtual who’s who of industry figures, the world’s most elite underground techno artists, and slews of ‘in the know’ clubbers.  This year, <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> will be bringing the 24 hour lesson in afterhours debauchery back to downtown Miami’s massive <strong>Ice Palace</strong>.  On Saturday night, the venue will open its huge indoor area for dancing, as well as outdoor terrace lounge for chilling.   The outdoor garden, complete with shade, seating, and DJ sets along with palm trees, verdant lawns, and bright yellow school buses, will be open for business all day on Sunday. As expected, the space will feature a unique layout, full bar and food for the entire 24 hours, and a fully customized sound system from <strong>Integral Sound</strong>.</p>
<p>The 2010 edition of <em>Sunday School For Degenerates</em> kicks off on the evening of Saturday, March 27th as <strong>Victor Calderone</strong> takes to the decks for a very special performance inside Ice Palace’s massive indoor area.  A veritable virtuoso of the scene, <em>Pacha NYC</em> resident DJ, Calderone has inspired, enthralled and entertained music fans the world over for 20+ years.  Lately, he has morphed his traditional tribal based sound into the realms of energizing techno, and doing so with amazing results.  This style has been on full display recently, including an inspired set at the<em> Sunday School</em> tent at the inaugural <em>Electric Zoo</em> festival in NYC.  Playing alongside Calderone will be <em>Drumcode </em>label head <strong>Adam Beyer</strong>.  Beyer has been a globetrotting ambassador of all things techno and the figurehead of the Swedish techno scene for well over a decade.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning and all day long, <em>SSFD</em> welcomes their eclectic lineup of techno heavyweights, beginning with Sunday School staple <strong>Adultnapper</strong>.  Every time he steps to the decks, he brings his haunting brand of micro rhythmic techno, enthralling and hypnotizing even the most jaded of audiences.   One of the most sophisticated and inspiring names in  techno, Frenchman <strong>Agoria </strong>brings his distinct sound to Miami for his Miami debut!  His <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 016: Agoria</span> is a huge 2CD mix which continues the compilation’s trend of releasing groundbreaking mixes from some of the world’s most forward thinking artists.  <em>Dig Deeper</em> founder and worldwide DJ favorite <strong>Danny Howells</strong> makes his first <em>SSFD</em> appearance this year.  Known for extended sets that push the limits of progressive, house, and techno, Danny Howells surely needs no further introduction.  <em>Get Physical</em> boss <strong>DJ T</strong> is veteran of the club scene for 20+ years and now leads one of the industry’s most respected labels.  He has just come off a world tour for his artist album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Inner Jukebox</span> and his latest mix, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fabric 51: DJ T</span> is out soon.  Parisian trio <strong>dOP</strong> have been relentlessly touring the world for the last three years and these <em>Supplemental Facts</em> favorites are bringing their unique and innovative live set.   One of the true underground hero’s of techno,<strong> Function</strong> is bringing his ferocious live set exclusively to Sunday School. Last year she was a newcomer, but with arguably one of the event’s favorite sets, Swedish <strong>Ida Engberg</strong> returns for round 2.   The king of eclectic techno and <em>Tyrant</em> partner <strong>Lee Burridge</strong> brings his wonky, bouncy, and sublime techno. <em>Freude Am Tanzen</em> and <em>Vakant</em> mainstay <strong>Mathias Kaden</strong> has built a unique sound based around funky and freaky rhythms drawn from global influences.  His latest album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Studio 10</span> attests to Mathias’ ability to focus on quality over quantity, centering diverse live performances around simple beats.  A Circo Loco favorite, <em>Moon Harbour</em>’s <strong>Matthias Tanzmann</strong> is rooted in deep grooves with a sound that ranges from European influenced deep house on through to minimal, and bordering on advanced techno.  Another favorite, <strong>Mr.C</strong> has been an underground hero for over two decades.  His collaboration with Adultnapper, <em><strong>Sycophant Slags</strong></em> has just released their “Keep Off” EP and video on Poker Flat Recordings. Minus artist and spanish techno veteran <strong>Paco Osuna</strong>’s rich textures, analogue EFX, loose drum crescendos, and memorable vocal samples will highlight his set from this <em>Plus 8</em> favorite.  Polish techno star <strong>Pawel</strong> plays exclusively for Sunday School, with a decade’s worth of single’s, a self titled artist album and the much respected label <em>Orphanear</em> to his credit. Adding something a little different to the stacked lineup of established techno heavyweights will be Frenchman <strong>Sébastien Léger</strong> adding his own signature sound to the mix.  Having recently been named #8 in Resident Advisor’s Best DJs of 2009 Poll, <strong>Seth Troxler</strong> has rapidly gained notoriety throughout the scene. From Detroit to Berlin and everywhere in between, Seth has made a name for himself playing some of the most unique sets in the business, while noticeably enjoying every minute he steps behind the decks. His next move for world domination is an unsurprisingly excellent compilation for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BPitch's Boogybytes Vol. 5</span>. Boston upstarts <strong>Soul Clap</strong> have busted onto the scene in a big way.  With releases on <em>Wolf + Lamb</em> and <em>Airdrop</em> to their credit, they are able to throw down sets comprised of everything from deep house and techno mixed with R&amp;B and soul elements.  Now returning for the 5th year, <em>Dessous</em>, <em>Poker Flat</em>, and <em>Audiomatique</em> founder <strong>Steve Bug</strong> has been one of the scene’s unsung pioneers and a <em>Made Event</em> favorite for some time. <strong>Tom Middleton</strong> brings his jedi mind tricks and canny ability to play almost any kind of music imaginable, while surprising all who think otherwise. Rounding out this massive lineup is <em>Dessous</em> favorite <strong>Vincenzo</strong>.  Drawing influence from the acid house movement of the late 80’s and bridging the gap between deep house and minimal, Vincenzo continues to reinvent electronic music, as well as collaborate with some of the scene’s finest.</p>
