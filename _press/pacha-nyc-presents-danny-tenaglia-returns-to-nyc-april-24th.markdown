<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
DANNY TENAGLIA<br />
Birthday Bash<br />
DT Returns to NYC</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> proudly presents the long-awaiting return of  <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong> as we celebrate his birthday at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, April 24th, 2010.</strong></span></p>
<p>The one and only <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong> returns to New York for his legendary birthday celebration! Fresh from demolishing Miami for the 24th year in a row, DT comes home to treat you with a slew of certified dancefloor bombs, from his brand new Lady Gaga remix to the twisted techno that keeps everyone's jaw (and feet) firmly on the floor. Fresh off three roaring parties at this year's Winter Music Conference, 2010 already see’s Danny Tenaglia maintaining a solid touring schedule with dates around the world.  A year that kicked off with his first Australian tour in a decade now sees Danny return to his native New York for his annual birthday blow-out.   Danny Tenaglia’s birthday bash has been a staple on the dance music calendars of club goers near and far.  From his earlier days at Vinyl to his newest residency at Pacha NYC, this “DJ’s DJ” is known to possess the uncanny ability to connect with his audiences, big or small, in the most intimate of ways.  With mixing skills that border on super human and an almost telepathic sense to consistently drop just the right record at just the right time, Danny Tenaglia is, simply put, one of the best in the business.  These days, even after almost three decades in the studio and behind the decks, it seems that Danny Tenaglia is enjoying the pinnacle of his career.  With one of dance music’s most adoring and loyal fan bases, he always packs the world’s top venues to capacity, while never disappointing the thousands in attendance.  Expect deep, dark house from classics both past, present and future to make up an extended set which will give the city yet another excuse not to sleep.</p>
