<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.cieloclub.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-1831 aligncenter" title="Cielo" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Cielo.jpg" alt="Cielo" width="221" height="74" /></a><br />
<strong>Cielo : December 2009 News</strong></p>
<p>As the temperatures drop outside, the atmosphere inside <strong>Cielo</strong> heats up as we edge ever nearer to 2010 with an amazing and equally eclectic selection of guest performers to see the year out in fine style. Right then, down to business and December once more highlights exactly why Cielo is a multi-award winning club with another cutting edge selection of visionary guest DJs that compliment our equally applauded residents.</p>
<p>Cielo hosts not one but two award winning nights every week. <em><strong>Roots</strong></em> with <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> and <strong>Louie Vega</strong> every Wednesday delivers a sensuously soulful night of Latin-infused house and samba-kissed rhythms. While <em><strong>Deep Space </strong></em>on Monday is a truly enveloping journey of tripped out house, dubbed beats and stark electronica masterminded by <strong>Francois K</strong>. If you miss it, don’t worry, seven days later it all happens again.</p>
<p>First up on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday 3rd</strong></span> is <em><strong>Immerse</strong></em> with special guests <strong>Glimpse</strong> spinning and playing alongside the highly esteemed <strong>Chris Fortier</strong>. Glimpse, Londoner Chris Spero, arrives in New York as part of a world tour taking in dates as far afield and glamorous as Rome, Barcelona, Berlin, Lisbon and Tokyo. 2009 has been a fantastic year for him, the last few months have seen Spero release material of Carl Craig’s Planet E label, his own Glimpse Recordings imprint with Kompakt and Get Physical’s sister label Kindisch, along with his debut solo album, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Runner</strong></span>’, on Four Twenty Records. As a DJ his sets are a hypnotizing, multi-dimensional live experience where melodic and organic beats fuse with deep-layered Detroit-influences and jacking house elements. It’s the perfect accompaniment to Chris Fortier, one of the most well respected and liked DJs on the circuit that regularly sees him touring alongside old friends and allies likes John Digweed, Sasha and Dave Seaman. As a producer Chris was also instrumental in developing and advancing the ‘progressive sound’ in America that still continues to go from strength-to-strength.</p>
<p><em><strong>Turntables On The Hudson</strong></em> rocks to the rhythm for the final time in 2009 on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday 4th</strong></span> with <strong>Nickodemus</strong> and <strong>Ino</strong> selecting their favorites from past twelve months. Always an essential date for your diary, Turntables On The Hudson’s legendary parties have become a stable part of New York clubbing since 1998. Brooklyn’s foremost outer national DJ Nickodemus, is also currently promoting his upcoming album, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sun People Remixed</strong></span>’. As the title suggests, this release brings together some of the world’s finest and most eclectic remixers offering new interpretations of tracks culled from Nickodemus’ acclaimed sophomore artist album, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sun People</span>’. The resident TOTH deck general plays host to guest Ino from House Café Music in Spain for another quality night of deep house, sultry jazzy rhythms expertly blended with Eastern melodies and Afrocentric grooves.</p>
<p>In house music circles <strong>Tedd Patterson</strong> is up there amongst the great and good of the genre. A pivotal player in the now legendary Magic Sessions parties at the Miami Winter Music Conference, and the master of playing edifying and soul-satisfying house sets, Tedd and his acclaimed <em><strong>Vibal</strong></em> night celebrates its sixth anniversary at Cielo on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday 5th</strong></span>. He’s joined by special guests <strong>Hector Romero</strong>, offering musical support, and the infamous New York host and party starter, <strong>Vi Vacious</strong>, providing the eye candy and keeping them both in line! In recent years Hector Romero has progressed from the Def Mix camp backroom to rightfully headlining alongside fellow members Satoshi Tomiie, David Morales and Frankie Knuckles. A committed DJ since becoming hooked as a 13-year in the Bronx, ‘Baby Hec’, now tours the globe; whether he’s rocking it out at Pacha, Ibiza or in Greece, UK, France, Spain, Italy, America or Canada, Hector works hard at his craft, making sure clubbers have a good time. What sets Romero apart from the rest is his ability to reach out to the masses, making him a favorite with promoters and clubbers alike: “<em>Promoters love it when people go to the gigs and smile, and have a good time with their customers. I love it. It’s work, but it’s also good fun</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Tom Stephan</strong> defines transatlantic. Having moved to London in the ‘90s to study film, he brought with him his musical passion and a mission to recapture the vibe he’d heard created by Junior Vasquez during his clubbing days at the Sound Factory. Ditching celluloid for vinyl he reinvented himself into his now internationally known Superchumbo protagonist guise. First came “The Revolution”, then groundbreaking remixes for Missy Elliot, Kylie and Basement Jaxx… and the Big Apple native has never looked back. Fast-forward to present day and you can hear Tom’s trademark mind-enveloping sound collages of darker percussive elements, dark twisted drums and mesmerizing tension building house set on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday 10th</strong></span> as guest of <em><strong>Dance.Here.Now.</strong></em></p>
<p>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday 11th</strong></span> the <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> host a night in the hands of trance pioneer <strong>Matt Darey</strong>. Throughout his 17-year career of producing and writing house, trance, breaks and progressive tracks, he’s sold well over 2 million albums and singles with a handful of crossover hits in the process, while his Nocturnal radio show is the world’s fastest expanding multi-genre dance radio show now broadcast on 123 FM stations worldwide (and rising!). In recent years Matt has been playing his unique Nocturnal blend to clubbers the world over fusing electro, progressive, tech, trance and breaks to his sets. Returning to Cielo for his third visit of the year, the master at whipping up the tempo and fuelling the adrenaline with his incisive glitch-ridden sets defines the word “euphoric”!</p>
<p>After another sellout session in Ibiza, <strong>Roger Sanchez</strong> returns to his hometown on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday 17th</strong></span> for <em><strong>Secret Soul Sessions</strong></em>. “<em>It has been amazing, the response we have got, we’ve been full all summer long,</em>” he says reflecting on the continued success of his Release Yourself night (Sanchez also hosts a terrestrial and online radio show of the same name with 1,200,000 listeners worldwide). It’s also given him a chance to road test “Together”, his rather large B52s-sampling dancefloor devastator, and the first single to drop from his forthcoming artist album, which is currently in the planning stages and, if schedules permit, will feature appearances from MC Flipside and hip-hop legend Afrika Bambaataa. “<em>A lot of different artists, a lot of different vibes</em>,” says Roger of the plans for his first new album in four years. “<em>It will take a bit of time to get everything right, but I’m setting my sights on releasing it next year.</em>” Ask the man from Queens what makes a good DJ great and answer rolls off his tongue: “<em>The ability to connect with your crowd, read the atmosphere and tailor your set to reflect that.</em>” Come hear for yourself why DJ Mag readers consistently vote the S-Man one of the world’s Top 100 DJs.</p>
<p>Sonic love travels in many dimensions — through visceral pathways of the senses, as a uniting force on dancefloors everywhere, in movements spanning entire eras to unify — whether souls, states or nations. And as sonic love relates to house music, <strong>Marques Wyatt</strong> is a seminal pioneer. In the mid ‘80s, at a time when the shape shifting of house music was rarely heard outside Chicago and New York, Marques introduced the East Coast sound to his native Los Angeles. In the ensuing years his prowess as a talented DJ, promoter, and producer has earned him recognition as one of the most sought-after artists in the genre. Marques continues to spread the gospel of house by globe-trotting from Shanghai to Barcelona, and Tel Aviv to Dubai with the mission to bring musical unity, light and love to all souls in his pathway. Experience the quintessential sound of Marques Wyatt on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday 18th</strong></span> as Cielo welcome a true musical visionary.</p>
<p><strong>Louie Vega</strong>, our Roots resident and in-house master at work behind the decks, extends the hand of friendship one and all to his <em><strong>Vega Records Christmas Party</strong></em> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunday 20th</strong></span>. It may be zero outside but with Louie, and a number of special guest friends by his side, a night is promised of afro-centric house jams where deep, soulful beats and Latin-infused grooves create an atmosphere to match the warmth and intimacy of Cielo and melt away the winter blues.</p>
<p>Christmas might come but once a year, but Cielo comes 3-6-5 and to underscore the point <strong>Willie Graff </strong>will be under the mistletoe on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday 25th</strong></span> as <em><strong>Playtime</strong></em> provides the perfect escapism from the stresses and strains of Christmas Day in the City. Since the ‘80s Willie has been creating eclectic and sensuous sets that meld euphoric soulful house with organic Balearic grooves, supple electronic textures and percussive Afro-Latin rhythms that have led to residencies at Pacha, Ibiza and of course at Cielo, NYC. Expect a self-assured set of deep soulful grooves, Latin-kissed beats and a spiritual message to match the DJ’s cool and silky smooth persona.</p>
<p>And so to <em><strong>New Years Eve 2009</strong></em> at Cielo… come celebrate the very best musical soundtrack of 2009 in the more then capable hands of <strong>Willie Graff</strong>, with special guests, playing out the old and welcoming in the new. Come early to get in the party mood and stay till next year!</p>
<p><em>Finally from all of us at Cielo we thank you for your amazing support and love in 2009, and wish you all a very happy, healthy, peaceful and successful 2010. See you on the dancefloor!</em></p>
