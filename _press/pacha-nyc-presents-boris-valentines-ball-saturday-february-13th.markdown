<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
BORIS<br />
Valentine's Ball<br />
New Pachita DJ Residency DJ RIZ </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> proudly presents the return of New York superstar <strong>DJ Boris</strong> for his fourth annual Valentine's Ball on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, February 13th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p><em>Looking for love?</em> Believe in<strong> Boris </strong>to help you find that special someone on the dancefloor. With numerous attendance record-setting events under his belt, a successful New Years Eve party, followed by a blow-out on the Terrace at <em>Space Miami</em>, Boris charged into 2010 with a headlining set on the <em>Groove Cruise</em>, alongside Benny Benassi, Mind Control, and Serge Devant. Now after a 2-month Pacha hiatus, Boris makes his grand return for the fourth installation of his popular annual February celebration of love. Whether you come alone or bring a date, Boris will make you BELIEVE in love.</p>
<p>Adding to the festivities, <em>Crooklyn Clan</em>'s <strong>DJ Riz</strong> launches his new 2010 residency in Pachita. DJ Riz’s impact on the hip-hop and DJ sound can be heard in every record, in every club around the globe. Covering the entire spectrum of the hip-hop/mashup world, Riz has set the standard in the genre. Because of his hard work, and ear-to-the-streets- knowledge of what’s popping, Riz—along with fellow Crooklyn Clan member DJ Sizzahandz—has produced some of the hottest remixes, and original tracks. The transition record is a Riz creation that exemplifies his impact—its introduction into the music world forever changed the way DJs hype up a crowd. Riz continues to do his thing, regularly adding to his world famous DJ site—<a href="http://">www.crooklynclan.net</a>.</p>
