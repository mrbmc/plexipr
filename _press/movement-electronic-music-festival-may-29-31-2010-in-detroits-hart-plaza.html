<p><em><strong>Movement Electronic Music Festival is Powered By Ford Fiesta for 2010 </strong></em><br />
Paxahau has teamed up this year with Ford Motor Company to present the Movement Electronic Music Festival Powered by Ford Fiesta Saturday, May 29 through Monday May 31.</p>
<p>“<em>We are pleased to be partnering with Ford Motor Company for the 10th anniversary of the festival,</em>” said Jason Huvaere, Executive Director of Movement Electronic Music Festival Powered by Ford Fiesta. “<em>It is important to our team to find brands to support the festival that really understand and respect the audience that attends Movement; and we think Ford is that type of sponsor.</em>”</p>
<p>Ford Motor Company is very familiar with the terrain of the annual music festival that for the last decade has drawn tens-of-thousands of Techno and electronic dance music fans to downtown Detroit each year from across the globe every Memorial Day Weekend.</p>
<p>In 2001 Ford Motor Company participated in the electronic music festival in Detroit as part of the launch of the Ford Focus.</p>
<p>“<em>The Ford Fiesta and the electronic music festival go together hand-in-hand</em>,” said Jeff Eggen, Ford car experiential marketing manager. “<em>We felt like the vibrant nature of Fiesta would come to life in a setting like this, and the attendees will truly appreciate what Fiesta is all about.</em>”</p>
<p>Going on sale this summer, the all-new Ford Fiesta features an expressive, vibrant design, sharp reflexes, and a global track record that will redefine U.S. small car customers’ expectations. With 15 class-exclusive technologies and a projected best-in-class highway fuel economy of 40 mpg, Fiesta brings efficiency and convenience together in one package.</p>
<p>Fiesta is designed to be versatile, personal and adaptable. In fact, Fiesta is expected to deliver best-in-class convenience and connectivity with Ford’s segment-exclusive SYNC® voice-activated communications system, as well as an expressive color palette and available graphics.</p>
