<p>Made Event presents Italian techno titan MAURO PICOTTO and Dutch phenom SANDERVAN DOORN at Webster Hall– Friday, December 7th, 2007.</p>
<p>After many years spending half his life producing and doing A&amp;R for BXR Records at the Media Records studio complex in Brescia, Italy, and half DJing every weekend, Mauro Picotto decided in 2003 to dedicate his energy towards to his DJ career and his own Meganite branded events and parties. Now with Meganites in London, Miami, Turin, Glasgow, Montreal, and at Priviledge in Ibiza, Mauro frequently plays much of his own music designed specifically for the mood &amp; energy of these nights. His sound now is a fusion of funky minimal house, with the techy edge and melodic elements that were always involved with his trademark sound. With renewed energy in 2007, Mauro sees the release of his new artist album 'Now &amp; Then’, on the brand new imprint SW Records and the Meganite Ibiza 2007 CD and DVD, following another successful season of the Meganite residency in Ibiza, now in its 4th year. This is a fresh and exciting new chapter in Mauro’s incredible career, and Now &amp; Then is an excellent album marking a brilliant shift in musical direction.</p>
<p>In just four years, and coming out of nowhere Sander van Doorn’s rapid ascent continues with his latest #15 ranking in the DJ Mag Top 100 poll and the launch of his own label Doorn Records. With Sander on A&amp;R duties, the ethos behind Doorn Records is simple – to discover new, unsigned talent and expose it to the world. To date the response has been tremendous with heaps of new tracks being submitted, be it via Myspace or the website. The first release on Doorn Records will be Sander’s own massive “Riff” with a killer remix by none other than techno giant, mister CARL COX! On the horizon for 2008, Sander readies his long-awaited debut long player and a global album tour.</p>
