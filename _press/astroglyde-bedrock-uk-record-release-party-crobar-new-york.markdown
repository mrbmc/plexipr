<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h2><b>Astro&Glyde (Bedrock UK) Record Release Party<br />
crobar New York<br />
June 4, 2004<br />
</h2>
<p></b></p>
<p>Join us for <b>ASTRO&GLYDE\'s</b> record release party on one of the most respected dance music labels in the world, <b>John Digweed\'s BEDROCK</b> (UK) record label at newly minted NYC clubbing hotspot <b>CROBAR</b> on Friday, June 4th. </p>
<p><b>ASTRO&GLYDE</b>, the ubiquitous NYC duo of <b>Gaby Dershin & James Bem</b> have been storming on their weekly Sunday sessions at the notorious <b>Le Souk SHAMELESS</b> parties. For a dedicated cadre of serious clubbers this was the after-after party that carried on until Monday morning. In the city that never sleeps, this is the party that never ends with Astro&Glyde at the helm. There\'s an upfront energy and twisted journey you take during an Astro&Glyde DJ set. Gaby & James have that keen sixth sense, as DJs who understood what it takes to keep the party going and inspire a crowd long after the weekend should technically be over. When the beat never stops, 24-7 takes on a whole new meaning in New York and with Astro&Glyde leading the charge, it means going the distance!</p>
<p>Their new track \"<b><i>Aimless Dame</b></i>\" was signed to <b>BEDROCK</b> by <b>JOHN DIGWEED</b> himself after listening to a CDR in his NYC hotel room\'s CD player whilst in town for a gig. The track takes on a life of its own with pulsing, gritty New York heat, just as summer begins to take hold. The dark, melodic hook gears up to seduce people onto dance floors worldwide with edgy vocal courtesy of NYC punk rock royalty <b>Queen V.</b> On the flip side, a brilliant deep house track given fantastic and techy twists by Tigerhook Corporation\'s <b>Randall Jones</b>. </p>
<p>Join us as we celebrate this milestone in their burgeoning careers, poised to inspire a new generation of clubbers and future DJs. </p>
<p>We have a limited # of \"<b><i>Aimless Dame</b></i>\" [Bedrock] on vinyl out now. Please reserve your review copy now.</p>
