FERRY CORSTEN<br />
'CORSTEN'S COUNTDOWN TOUR'</strong><br />
<em>A Digital Release Compilation Available From Ultra Records</em></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents <strong>FERRY CORSTEN</strong> on the '<em>Corsten's Countdown Tour</em>' landing at <strong>Pacha NYC </strong>on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, April 18th.</span></strong></p>
<p>Known as the "architect, pioneer, and instigator" of trance music's global dominance, <strong>FERRY CORSTEN</strong> is also one of the world's top DJs and a tastemaker in the genre. The latter title can be best exemplified by his newest release <em>CORSTEN'S COUNTDOWN MIX</em> a digital only compilation available March 25 from Ultra Records that's based on his popular XM Radio show.</p>
<p><em>CORSTEN'S COUNTDOWN MIX</em> is based on a one-hour weekly radio show that Ferry began in July 2007 introducing new tracks and playing his current favorite records while listeners vote on his website for the countdown show that airs at the end of each month. For this new release, Ferry has compiled the top featured tracks from the last year. The show is broadcasted every Wednesday night at 2pm EST US on<a href="http://"> www.di.fm </a>and every Thursday at 12am EST on XM Radio.</p>
<p>Recently named the "Best Trance DJ" at the annual DJ Awards in Ibiza, beating out nominees Armin van Buuren, Astrix, Infected Mushroom and Above &amp; Beyond, Corsten is one of only five DJs to have been voted in the top 10 in the world by DJ Magazine's definitive "Top 100 DJ" chart for the last five years. He has played for hundreds of thousands of fan in amphitheaters, fields and nightclubs throughout the world and has even had his life's work interpreted in music, video and d√©cor at UDC's Masquerade event, at 12,000-capacity arena Ahoy in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. An accomplished producer and remixer, who has remade the likes of Duran Duran, U2, Moby, and Public Enemy and even Fox's "Prison Break" theme song, Corsten aims to create the most energetic and melodic records in dance music.</p>
<p>The '<em>Corsten's Countdown Tour</em>' marks Ferry's return to the U.S. club scene since June and early July 2007 when he blasted his way throughout the country in support of his <em>Passport United States of America</em> disc (released June 19 on Ultra).</p>
