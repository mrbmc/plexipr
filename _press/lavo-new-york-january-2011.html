<p><strong>Thursday, January 6 – AVICII</strong><br />
Avicii was recently named Breakthrough DJ/Producer of 2010 by trance king Tiesto in  DJ Mag’s Top 100 issue (in which Avicii himself earned a spot at #39), which is no surprise as his hit tracks “My Feelings For You” and “Bromance” both rose incredibly quickly to top the Beatport Top 100 charts. Avicii played all over the world last year, including several gigs in Ibiza, where he opened for Tiesto and Swedish House Mafia, as well as Sensation White Festival in St. Petersburg, Surfcomber Pool Party in Miami and Electric Zoo Festival in New York. The Swedish DJ has also stamped his unique house sound on remixes for Tiesto, Bob Sinclar, Dizzee Rascal, Sophie Ellis Baxter, Little Boots and David Guetta and has collaborated with Tiesto, Sebastian Ingrosso from Swedish House Mafia and many more.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, January 13 – EC TWINS &amp; CHUCKIE</strong><br />
Underground sensations the EC Twins and Dirty Dutch master Chuckie are teaming up for a night of non-stop dancing. Named after a successful club they once created in the U.K. (Eye Candy), the EC Twin’s electronic sounds and energetic performances have earned them passionate fan bases from Northern Europe to South East Asia. They have performed at the hottest nightclubs and festivals around the world, and their long list of production work includes their hit remix of Andy Caldwell’s “Scream.” Joining in is international DJ and producer Chuckie, who has brought his own massively popular "Dirty Dutch" club concept (which has included the likes of David Guetta and NERD) and killer tracks such as "Let The Bass Kick" and "Aftershock" around the world. He has been working with megastars like Jermaine Dupri, P Diddy, Lil Jon, Estelle, Toni Braxton and Akon and landed a multi album artist deal with Atlantic Records in the USA last year.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, January 20 – TATIANA FONTES</strong><br />
Brazilian born Tatiana Fontes returns with her crowd-pleasing fusion of the 80s and rock from her youth, along with European house and electronic music. She already boasts a diverse selection of careers: international supermodel, Hollywood actress, and now back to her true passion as a DJ. With a father who was a nightclub owner and brothers who were professional DJs, Tatiana grew up in the DJ booth and her affinity for music was a homegrown affair.</p>
