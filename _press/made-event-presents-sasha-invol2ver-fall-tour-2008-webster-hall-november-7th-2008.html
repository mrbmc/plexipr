SASHA<br />
Invol2ver Fall Tour 2008<br />
with<br />
Ulrich Schnauss</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event </strong>presents the genre defying legendary DJ/Producer <strong>Sasha</strong> with <strong>Ulrich Schnauss</strong> at <strong>Webster Hall</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, November 7th</strong></span> for one of his final performances on the Invol2ver Tour.</p>
<p>Finally, after 4 years, false tracklistings, fake torrent downloads and even doctored artwork,<strong> Sasha</strong>'s "Invol2ver", the follow up to the album that redefined the DJ mix has arrived. It quickly garnered a #1 spot on iTunes' US Dance Chart after its digital release and has since remained in the top 25.Â  Invol2ver has recently been nominated for the prestigious People's Design Award and Sasha was named Top Progressive House DJ at this year's DJ Awards in Ibiza.</p>
<p>Featuring 13 tracks worth of Sasha gold, the standard edition features Sasha's unique re-workings of musical giants such as Radiohead's Thom Yorke and American folk singer Ray LaMontagne as well as formidable electronic artists Apparat and Ladytron, while the limited edition comes equipped with a second CD of Sasha remix exclusives. These include alternative edits of Charlie May's 'Midnight (Extended Mix)', Home Video's 'Gas Tank (Sasha Invol2ver Remix)', Lostep's 'Burma (Involver Dub Mix)', Thom Yorke's 'Eraser (Sasha Coma Remix)', Sasha Vs Ray LaMontagne 'Eclipse (CM Dub Mix)' and Girls In Hawaii 'Flavor (Sasha Invol2ver Remix)'.</p>
<p>Joining Sasha for this very special night of music is Ulrich Schnauss, the Berlin-based artist known for creating a sound that meanders between shoegazer and dance while also demonstrating his skill for songwriting.</p>
