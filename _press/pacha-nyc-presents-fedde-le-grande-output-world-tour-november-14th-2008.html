Output World Tour<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> is pleased to present the Dutch DJ and producer <strong>Fedde Le Grande</strong>, famous for the catchy electro-house hit single <em>"Put Your Hands Up For Detroit"</em> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, November 14th</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Fedde Le Grande</strong> returns to New York City for one night only as part of his world tour promoting his debut artist album "Output" set for release in January '09 on Ultra Records.Â  Renowned for his dynamite sets as much as for his high-end production, this is a rare chance for clubbers on this side of the Atlantic to catch Le Grand live.</p>
<p>Fedde Le Grand is already one of the biggest stars in dance music, working with the likes of Madonna, Will.i.am and the Stereo MC's, while topping international music charts. Via his own Flamingo Records, Le Grand produced the world-wide pop-crossover smash "Put Your Hands Up For Detroit," also released by Ultra Records in 2007. The song hit #1 in the U.K., Spain, Russia, Finland and Bulgaria dance charts. In addition, it was voted Best "Underground House Track" and "Best Breaks/Electro Track" at the International Dance Music Awards in 2007 and won "Club Banger Of The Year" at the 6th Annual Club Awards in 2008.</p>
