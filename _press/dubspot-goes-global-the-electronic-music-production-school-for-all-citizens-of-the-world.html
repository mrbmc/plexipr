<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>DUBSPOT GOES GLOBAL</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Introducing Dubspot Online, The Electronic Music Production School<br />
For All Citizens Of The World</strong></h2>
<p>After revolutionizing the way New York learns about music production, DJing and live performance,<strong> Dubspot</strong> is taking its renowned instructors and classroom experience worldwide. Introducing <strong>Dubspot Online</strong>, a revolutionary new online educational platform that individually connects students around the world directly with their instructors and peers. However hectic your life may be, now you have time to follow your dreams. Unlike classes that only meet at a certain time in a certain place, Dubspot brings the knowledge directly to you.</p>
<p><strong>Dubspot Online</strong> stems from the same philosophy that founded the school: music technology is only as good as the music you make. Principles are incorporated and practiced versus memorized. Individual progress and artistic growth are encouraged through consistent weekly feedback and direct advice from instructors, as students constantly create new tracks and apply what they learn. High quality videos, along with audio and text documentation accompany every lesson, and a revolutionary new online community provides a unique venue for sharing ideas and enriching the learning experience.</p>
<p>The new <strong>Dubspot Online Community</strong> expands the school’s renowned family of like-minded artists, DJs, and producers to an international scale. A varied selection of forums, connected to various courses and tailored to project feedback, as well as technical, artistic, and cultural discussions, encourages interactions on a variety of topics all essential to a well-rounded music education. Participants will not only include students, but the school’s faculty, staff, and artist network of established DJs and producers. Additional tutorials, event, and workshop invitations will also be available, exclusively to online students.</p>
