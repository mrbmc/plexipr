<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
ATB<br />
‘Future Memories’ Album Release Tour<br />
<em>@ Pacha NYC</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> proudly presents the New York stop of German trance superstar <strong>ATB</strong>’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Future Memories</strong></span> album release tour at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 19, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As electronic music grows into an increasingly global phenomenon, it is without a doubt that <strong>ATB</strong> belongs in the elite of the global electronic community. Traveling to different countries every week while creating timeless music along the way, ATB has reached the point of global success, while keeping both feet firmly on the ground and never losing sight of his fans and quality trance music.</p>
<p>It seems hard to believe, but a decade has passed since ATB made waves with his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Movin Melodies</span> album. 10 years, in which he has traveled the globe over and over, mesmerizing his fans the world over with his unique DJ sets. A decade which provided no less than 8 albums including the newest LP<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Future Memories</strong></span>.  The album comes just in time to lighten up our summer days and nights with exquisite electronic music, melodic yet pulsating.</p>
<p>In describing the album ATB states that his methodology was different this time around. “<em>Unlike the last album, which was very much based on classic songwriting and real instruments, Future Memories has more of a focus on keyboards and synthesizers again. I wanted to get back to my roots in electronic sounds.</em>” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future Memories</span> contains 26 tracks on two CDs. The first features driving, melodic club music, the second takes on a more ambient style.</p>
<p><em>ATB<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Future Memories</span> is available now on Kontor Records</em>.</p>
