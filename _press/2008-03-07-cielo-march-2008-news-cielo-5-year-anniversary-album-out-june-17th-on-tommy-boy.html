<p id="post_message_1223871" class="post_message"><strong>Cielo</strong> is pleased to announce that their <strong>5th Anniversary</strong> will be marked by the 5th release in the highly-acclaimed Cielo compilation series. The new compilation <strong>Cinco</strong> mixed and compiled by residents <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> and <strong>Willie Graff</strong> will be released by <strong>Tommy Boy</strong> on <strong>June 17th</strong>. Later this month, Cielo will be well-represented at the 6th annual Club World Awards in Miami on March 26th at Set during Winter Music Conference, with nominations for Best Club (past winner 2005 &amp; 2006), Best Party - Dance.Here.Now. and Best Resident DJ- Louie Vega at Roots.</p>
<p>This month, Cielo hosts the crème of New York and international DJ talent with another fine selection of some of the world’s leading house exponents.</p>
<p><strong>Francois K</strong> kicks off a month of seriously seductive Monday nights as “Deep Space” lives up to its name with a truly enveloping journey of tripped out house, dubby beats and Francois’ unique blend of electronica. If you miss one Monday, don’t worry, seven days later it all happens again… and then again.</p>
<p><strong>“Roots”</strong> finds <strong>Louie Vega &amp; Kevin Hedge</strong> on deck duty at their weekly Wednesday soiree, where they’ll no doubt be road testing some past, present and future Miami classics ahead of the Winter Music Conference.</p>
<p>Cielo resident <strong>Willie Graff</strong> graces the decks every Friday for his “Play Time” night playing the same style of deep and tech-etched house that earned him the title of Pacha Ibiza’s youngest ever resident DJ. He’s made their Funky Room his own over the past few summers and Cielo’s dancefloor his domain the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>Berlin native and the mastermind behind Poker Flat Recordings, <strong>Steve Bug</strong>, headlines the Made Event on Thursday 20th. Fresh from sell-out dates in Australia and Japan, the night will feature his seminal tech-house infused beats, seductive funk grooves and edifyingly rich sonic soundscapes.</p>
<p>To mark the release of <strong>Cielo’s</strong> first <strong>Japanese CD</strong>, on <strong>Friday 21st</strong> we’re flying in Tokyo’s Masa - widely regarded as one of the most exciting house DJs in Japan. Masa’s no stranger to the US scene having previously worked with Blaze, Joi Cardwell, Ron Carroll, and Kenny Bobien, while as a member of Studio Apartment their acclaimed single ‘Flight’ won recognition far and wide with supporters including Gilles Peterson and Danny Krivit, and our own Francois K and Louie Vega.</p>
<p>London, Ibiza, New York and Sydney - Nicolas Matar has been there, seen that, done that. A DJ that refuses to be pigeonholed the Cielo resident’s monthly “Paradizo” night sees him joined by Willie Graff on the 22nd for a truly cosmopolitan affair named after our CD compilation that the guys also mixed.</p>
<p>Kristian Beyer from celebrated Sonar Kollectiv act Ame graces us on the 27th with a slick DJ set. The cult collective represents all that is cool, credible and sophisticated in the modern world of broken-beat and deep jazzy-house and the night promises to be another of the month’s do-not-miss events.</p>
<p>Finally, Friday 28th sees Nickodemus &amp; Mariano, alongside talented percussionist Nappy G, join us for “Turntables on the Hudson”. Now into their tenth year of throwing parties the guys return for their monthly residency of sultry jazz rhythms, Eastern melodies and Afrocentric grooves.</p>
