<p>Steve Porter\'s new album <b><u><i>PORTERHOUSE</b></u></i> hits the streets today in anticipation of his annual Winter Music Conference Porterhouse party - this year to be held as a kick-off to the conference on <b><u>Wednesday, March 22</u> @ Suite</b> with elaborate decorations, live visuals, dancers and all the Porterhouse bells and whistles to make this the standout event of WMC 2006.</p>
<p><b>Steve Porter </b>releases his first-ever mix compilation <b><u><i>PORTERHOUSE</b></u></i> with 26 tracks melded together in his signature genre-defying, pulsating, energetic Porterhouse style. The album merges his DJing and production style with 9 of his own original tracks, further blurring the distinction between DJ and producer into one compelling artist to watch. </p>
<p>The <b><i></p>
