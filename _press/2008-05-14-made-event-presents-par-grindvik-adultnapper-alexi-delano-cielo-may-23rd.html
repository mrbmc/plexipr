Made Event presents<br />
Pär Grindvik<br />
w/ Adultnapper<br />
(Audiomatique 2.0 Album Release Party)<br />
Alexi Delano</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents a trifecta of techno talent starring <strong>Pär Grindvik</strong> and NYC's own <strong>Adultnapper</strong> and <strong>Alexi Delano</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 23rd</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Par Grindvik</strong> has been a core artist in Sweden's electronic music since the nineties as a record store-owner, label manager and producer. After many years of touring and releases on classic labels like Adam Beyer's Drumcode, he is now based in Berlin. Grindvik is an artist that always aims to compose music that adds sparkle and curiosity to the scene and he also runs the brilliant Stockholm LTD label.</p>
<p>After blistering tag-team sets at the AM Only One Night Only party at Winter Music Conference and down south in Columbia, Adultnapper and Alexi Delano have been hotly tipped as the latest dynamic duo. With their shared intensity for sophisticated and engaging electronic music and fine mixing finesse, they are also both torchbearers for Germany's Audiomatique Recordings overseen by Steve Bug.</p>
<p>NYC's arch tech selector <strong>Adultnapper</strong> is set to release the next installment of Steve Bug's Audiomatique imprint with its second label compilation, Audiomatique Volume 2.0. The album is a descent into the deepest realms of electronic rhythm, veering from the spare crisp minimalism of Gui Boratto and Martin Eyerer's ‘The Beach', to the moody, strobe lit melancholy of Minus producer Gaiser's ‘Found Guilty Mix' of Adultnapper's own ‘Juror no. 9'. A perfect snapshot of the label's diverse roster, Adultnapper subtly builds the mix from stripped back, echoic grooves to tougher club battering technoid epics. It's Adultnapper‘s mix that illustrates the electronic zeitgeist of the moment and offers a glimpse of where house and techno are heading in the future.</p>
<p>Born in Chile, raised in Sweden, <strong>Alexi Delano</strong> has thrived in NYC as an underground DJ/Producer and an international man of music that has been working the dancefloors for over 15 years. Last year Alexi co-produced a new album "Chronicle Of The Urban Dwellers" (Harthouse Mannheim) with his old friend Jesper Dahlback under their alias ADJD and released the "What Is Control" EP for Steve Bug's Audiomatique label and another for Adam Beyer's TrueSoul recordings. Now he is currently awaiting his new EP - A.D.N.Y. "Forms EP" feat. "Under My Skin" &amp; "Zero Too Deep" on Adultnapper's cryptic new label, Ransom Note and another one on his own label AD LTD and has also recently contributed a track for the Minus crew's new label Items and Things.</p>
