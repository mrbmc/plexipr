Pacha NYC presents<br />
MARK KNIGHT<br />
Toolroom Knights Tour<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents label head honcho and Ministry of Sound resident <strong>Mark Knight</strong> for his <em>'Toolroom Knights' </em>album release tour on <strong>Saturday, August 30th</strong>.</p>
<p>From the start of his Ministry residency in 2003 to the launch of ‘Toolroom Knights’ in 2006 Mark has continued to build a solid worldwide fan base, and further establish his status as a world premier DJ/producer. Now the Toolroom Records head honcho puts the needle to the record for the latest offering from the label’s compilation series. The 4th album in, and Toolroom Knights has firmly cemented itself into the clubbing lifestyle, offering a taste of what the label and their parties are all about – quality, forward-thinking House. A by-word for everything that’s hot in dance music right now, Mark Knight (and his Toolroom empire) has shaped the sound of dance since the early 00’s– playing and producing cutting edge House music, pioneering his distinctive ‘Toolroom’ sound.</p>
<p>This double-disc collection covers the length and breadth of the house music spectrum, moving from shades of legendary US producers right through to the current crop of ultra-talented UK and European artists.  It is a sound that Mark has lovingly cultivated over many years of solid gigging and through releasing a staggeringly consistent collection of quality music via his Toolroom imprint. The mix is by no means a straight run-through of current big tunes, rather a musical journey that takes in album exclusives, drawn-out mixing and carefully placed accapellas to coax the maximum levels of impact out of the records.</p>
<p><em>Toolroom Knights Mixed by Mark Knight is out now on Toolroom Records.</em></p>
