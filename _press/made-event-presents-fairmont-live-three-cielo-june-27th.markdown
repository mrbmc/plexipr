Made Event presents<br />
Fairmont (Live)<br />
+ Three</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents one of the leading techno upstarts breaking the mold at the eclectic Border Community label, Canadian artist <strong>Fairmont</strong> performing live at <strong>Cielo</strong> with <strong>Three</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 27th, 2008</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Jake Fairley's <strong>Fairmont </strong>album Coloured In Memory on James Holden’s influential Border Community imprint is a stunning showcase of the true depth and variety of his talents. The album unites Fairley's trademark driving analogue machine-funk with woozy, warm interludes, intimate vocals and drugged-out highs, fused with a touch of the experimental. From the very beginning, Jake's music has showed a focus on stretching minimal techno into pop. Making his name as a techno maverick, Fairley has produced almost 30 records in total, 100+ songs and 4 LPs. Spending much of his youth watching bands play live has pushed Jake to try and perform his music rather than merely present it. The once elusive Fairmont softer side had been transformed into a serious club concern, and the everlush melodies are now imbued with a new dancefloor sensibility with his live reputation growing as a sweaty, raw performer imbued with tripped out liquid melodies.</p>
<p>From his adopted home base of NYC, <strong>Three</strong> has been tirelessly holding the flag for underground electronic music in the US since his rise out of the sunny state of Florida in the early 90's. Armed with a sound that borrows equally from vintage acid-house, techno and underground electronica, his uncompromising Hallucination Limited imprint is held in the highest regard and the catalog will be available digitally for the first time on Beatport. Aside from his natural ability on the decks, Three sets himself apart from the rest of the pack by presenting eclectic sounds with an open-minded attitude towards everything he does. From DJ sets to musical output, Three is a "DJ's DJ" who has always leaned toward the cutting edge without losing touch with the roots of house and techno.</p>
