ROGER SANCHEZ + DIRTY SOUTH @ Dayclub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marquee resident and Grammy award-winning DJ Roger Sanchez earned his status as the go-to DJ for pop/house hits with recent remixes of Maroon 5, OneRepublic and Brandon Flowers, and previous remixes for Daft Punk, Diana Ross and No Doubt (which won him a Grammy). His contributions to the <em>Blade</em> soundtrack<em>,</em> early hits like “Luv Dancin”, “Another Chance” and “Release Yo Self” and world tours earned the New York native a global audience. This month he releases a brand new single “Worldwide,” followed by the ‘Release Yourself 11’ compilation, a legendary house music mix series that has grown into an International Dance Music Award-winning podcast and global clubbing concept. For his <em>Release Yourself</em> residency at Marquee, Roger transforms the club into a sexy burlesque boudoir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joining Roger will be fellow Marquee resident Dirty South, who earlier this year was nominated for the ‘Best Remixed Recording’ Grammy award along with Swedish House Mafia’s Axwell for their remix of The Temper Trap’s “Sweet Disposition.” He has also worked with dance music giants David Guetta and Sebastian Ingrosso (“How Soon Is Now”) and remixed some of music’s biggest names, including U2, Snoop Dogg and Depeche Mode. In between his heavy touring and producing schedule, Dirty South regularly releases compilations for labels such as Ministry Of Sound, Toolroom Records and SONY just to name a few. Last year saw the birth of his hit track “Phazing” from his label of the same name, which properly launched as a global clubbing concept, <em>Starphazing</em>, at Marquee Las Vegas and showcases his signature dark house sound and hands-in-the-air good vibes. With a hit remix of “Coming Home” by Diddy Dirty Money (feat. Skylar Grey) out now, this month Dirty South releases ‘Strictly Dirty South,’ a 2-CD set featuring legendary label Strictly Rhythm classics and Dirty South originals and remixes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Avicii returns again to Marquee to destroy the dancefloor with his unique house sound. Earlier this year, he won the International Dance Music Award for Best Breakthrough Solo Artist, which comes as no surprise, as Tiesto already named him Breakthrough DJ/Producer of 2010 in DJ Mag. Avicii has stamped his sound on remixes for Bob Sinclar, Dizzee Rascal, Sophie Ellis Baxter, Little Boots and David Guetta, and has collaborated with Tiesto, Sebastian Ingrosso from Swedish House Mafia and many more.
