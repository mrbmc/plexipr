<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cielo – April 2008 News<br />
Club World Award 2008 Winner<br />
Best Club &amp; Best Party: Dance.Here.Now</strong>.</p>
<p>Cielo is proud to announce wins in two of their three nominated categories at the sixth annual Club World Awards. Having previously won the "Best Club" award twice before (in 2005 and 2006), Cielo has now regained the crown for a third time and Dance.Here.Now. picks up top honors in the category of "Best Party". Congratulations also goes to Louie Vega who was nominated for Best Resident for his Roots night by the prestigious award's show that is generally regarded as the leader in its field. Meanwhile don't forget that Cielo's 5th Anniversary year will be marked by the release of ‘Cinco' - the brand new mix CD compiled by residents Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff to be released on Tommy Boy on June 17th.Now it's back to business after March Madness, Spring Break and the Winter Music Conference hogging the calendar, with April finding Cielo celebrating two anniversaries with both Roots and Deep Space, commemorating their respective 4th and 5th birthdays.</p>
<p><strong>François K</strong> kicks off Deep Space's 5th Anniversary Month of Monday's creating more rumbling bass-savvy grooves and his signature warm tripped out electronica. François is joined this month by two special guests: on the 14th <strong>DJ Spooky</strong> (aka That Subliminal Kid) for the DC-native's unique sonic milieu of trip-hop textures and ambient auras. Then on the 21st Cielo welcomes one of the founding fathers of Detroit techno, <strong>Kevin Saunderson</strong>. The groundbreaking producer helped pioneered the sound of techno in the ‘80s; was one of the first house artists to enjoy mainstream success with Inner City, before again packing dancefloors with the Reese Project and a handful of cult aliases. And don't forget admission before 11pm is free - so no excuses!</p>
<p>Dance.Here.Now., winner in the "Best Party" category at the Club World Awards, hosts a trio of parties here this month. The secret to the night's success is "<em>big name DJs in the confines of Cielo's intimate setting make for some of</em> <em>the best sets of the year,"</em> reveals Benny Soto, who promotes the party with Rob Fernandez. UK top-jock <strong>Danny Howells</strong> headlines on April 3rd with one of his Dig Deeper sets. From his residencies at Bedrock through to warming up for Robbie Williams, Danny is the epitome of cosmopolitan and a disciple of incessant tech-house and burbling progressive beats.</p>
<p>Another UK prog-house producer to grace our decks this month is <strong>Chris Lake</strong> as featured guest for Area Event on the 8th. A master at creating deep sub-bass grooves with progressive synth undertones, Chris has been at the forefront of the UK scene for several years with his 2006 single ‘Changes' already considered a classic.</p>
<p>Roots is back on April 9th and to mark the 4th Anniversary residents <strong>Louie Vega</strong> and <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> return from Miami with a handful of new promos to debut. Another of our trio of nominees at the Club World Awards (Louie was short-listed in the Best Resident category), the night is another afro-centric house jam where deep, soulful beats and Latin-infused grooves create an atmosphere to match the warmth and intimacy of Cielo.</p>
<p>Cielo Gets Deep with LA-based house head <strong>Marques Wyatt</strong> on Friday the 11th. Expect a self-assured set of deep soulful grooves with a spiritual message to match the DJ's cool and silky smooth persona. Wyatt will also be a monthly resident at Cielo this summer.</p>
<p>April 13th is the opening night of Freedom, the exclusive NYC residency of house legend <strong>Junior Vasquez</strong>. The man's first new home in over a decade will be celebrated with a live performance from the equally talented Kevin Aviance. With Junior you know what to expect, so make sure you secure a spot on the dancefloor for what promises to be a memorable night.</p>
<p>Then on April 17th, Dance.Here.Now. returns with <strong>Behrouz</strong>. Think Miami house with frenzied drum rolls, a smidgen of Yoshitoshi progressiveness and deep percussion and you'll be in the right ballpark. Less-is-most-definitely-more for this disciple of Danny Tenaglia.</p>
<p>The youthful and equally soulful Bronx duo <strong>The Martinez Brothers</strong> are the special guests for Dance.Here.Now. on the 24th. Introduced to house music by their father, Chris and Steve were discovered by Dennis Ferrer and last year released their debut single on his label when just 15 and 18 respectively. Tipped for greatness, the siblings are at the forefront of the next generation of New York house... but you can't buy them a drink to celebrate just yet!</p>
<p>Ariaan Olieroock and Peter Kriek are <strong>16 Bit Lolitas</strong> who headline the Made Event party on the 25th. With a handful of acclaimed releases to the Dutch duo's name, their fans now include Deep Dish, Jimmy Van M, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo; so with those guys in their corner you know the night's going to be one of April's must-hear sets.</p>
<p>And we've saved the best till last as Fresh Fruit presents <strong>Frankie Knuckles</strong> on the 27th. Reams could be written about Frankie - the City of Chicago even celebrated the pioneering Warehouse DJ by devoting a day in his honor. Dabbed "The Godfather of House," Knuckles learnt his DJ trade in New York working with the Paradise Garage's Larry Levan, before migrating south to experiment with drum machines and percussive loops under disco classics. He then made the transition to producing, cutting a handful of seminal releases including ‘Baby Wants To Ride', ‘Your Love' and ‘The Whistle Song'; and was one half of the formidable Red Zone remix partnership with David Morales. Knuckles partners up with Brooklyn boy Steve Travolta for a serious connoisseur's house set that is sure to captivate.<br />
