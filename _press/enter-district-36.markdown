<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/plexipr_D36logoFINAL_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2275 aligncenter" title="plexipr_D36logoFINAL_1" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/plexipr_D36logoFINAL_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="307" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ENTER DISTRICT 36</strong></p>
<p>A new beacon for New York nightlife will be ignited this fall in the heart of Manhattan – <strong>DISTRICT 36</strong>. The brand new, custom-built nightclub injects <em>originality </em>and <em>vitality</em> into the scene and will once again put forth New York City at the center of global clubbing.</p>
<p>District 36 will revive the tradition of classic New York dance clubs built for dance music enthusiasts by building on the pillars of the proper NY club: impeccable sound, exceptional music programming, superior hospitality and a dancefloor that gives you the intimacy of a small room but the power of a mega club. The three-level nightclub will feature an impeccable sound designed and engineered by <strong>Gary Stewart Audio</strong> - legendary for designing sound systems at some of the most renowned clubs around the world. In addition, the club has assembled a team of nightlife professionals who bring vast amounts of experience and expertise in building a successful nightclub.</p>
<p>District 36’s Musical Director <strong>Taimur Agha</strong> will be programming nights with the same philosophy behind his much-respected <em><strong>BlkMarket Membership </strong></em>parties: booking artists who have inspired him as a DJ and bringing in the talent that he would want to play alongside. In addition to bringing in the BlkMarket Membership parties for a new residency, both BlkMarket residents Taimur and Fahad will also be serving as District 36 resident DJs. The club’s much anticipated line-up, based on talent and ability rather than overhyped profiles, will provide a vital platform in NYC for the best in international DJ talent.</p>
<p>District 36 will also feature the next incarnation of <strong>Victor Calderone</strong>’s illustrious <em><strong>EVOLVE</strong></em> DJ residency. The legendary New York DJ handpicked the club to begin the next chapter of his legacy based on the club’s commitment to superior sound and its focus on building a technology-driven room for the next generation of clubbers. On the importance of his residency Calderone says, <em>“As a DJ it’s important to establish a connection with your audience and after traveling the world, instituting a regular base in NYC is like coming home. This residency will be a fresh start and as an artist it’s important to evolve, reenergize the crowd as well as myself and always stay ahead of the curve. Together we will build a new home for clubbers.”</em></p>
<p>Beyond the club events, District 36 Special Events Director <strong>Lee Blumer</strong>, formerly of Hammerstein Ballroom, crobar and most recently M2,  returns to nightlife with her talented team of consummate professionals. Her wealth of experience in film, Broadway, fashion and signature product launches will bring a sophisticated level of service to both large-scale events and intimate gatherings.</p>
