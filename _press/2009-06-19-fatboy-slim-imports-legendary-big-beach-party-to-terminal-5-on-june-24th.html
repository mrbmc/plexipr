<em>ONLY EAST COAST APPEARANCE!</em><br />
FATBOY SLIM<br />
with special guest<br />
SHINICHI OSAWA</strong></p>
<p>Norman Cook’s alter-ego<strong> Fatboy Slim</strong> touches down in NYC for an exclusive east coast appearance at <strong>Terminal 5</strong> on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Wednesday, June 24th</strong></span>. As one of dance music’s pioneers, Fatboy Slim’s legendary <em>Big Beach Boutique</em> parties launched a dance music renaissance in the early 00's. Now for the first time ever, he brings his spectacular stadium show indoors to Terminal 5 for a special one-off summer celebration.</p>
<p>As chairman of the legendary music collective, <strong>The Brighton Port Authority </strong>(aka The BPA), Cook and fellow cohorts; Simon Thornton, Thomas Gandey, Justin Robertson, Ashley Beedle, Lateef, Martha Wainwright, Jamie T, David Byrne, Iggy Pop, Olly Hite, Conan, Pete York, Jack Penate, Emmy The Great, Dizzee Rascal, took what started as a series of 48-hour warehouse parties in Brighton throughout the 1970's, and resulted in a series of recording sessions – lost, then found – then finally culminated in an album called “I Think We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat”.</p>
<p>Cook along with BPA partner-in-crime<strong> Iggy Pop</strong>, will take the sounds of the BPA to New York institution <em>The Late Show with David Letterman </em>(June 22nd), then to <em>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon </em>(June 23rd), before reemerging as his Fatboy Slim persona for an unprecedented party when he takes the stage at Terminal 5 (June 24th).</p>
<p><em>BPA "I Think We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat" is out on Southern Fried Records.</em></p>
