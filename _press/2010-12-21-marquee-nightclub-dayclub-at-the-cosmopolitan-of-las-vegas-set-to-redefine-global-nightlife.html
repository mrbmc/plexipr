<p>LAS VEGAS – World renowned nightlife impresarios and the force behind such New York and Las Vegas destinations as TAO and LAVO will once again change the nightlife landscape with the opening of <strong>Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub</strong> at <strong>The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas</strong>. Veteran operators Louis Abin, Jason Strauss, Marc Packer, Rich Wolf and Noah Tepperberg will debut the Las Vegas outpost of Marquee, a Manhattan nightlife fixture, as Las Vegas welcomes 2011.</p>
<p><em>“Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub will unite the very best of every great international city’s music scene into one spectacular and singular setting,”</em> notes partner Louis Abin. <em> “The club’s truly unique attributes serve as the ideal nightlife complement to The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.”</em></p>
<p>Marquee intends to be the number one destination for the world’s premier music talent and has secured a number of top international acts and DJs to take center stage at the venue’s unveiling. In conjunction with The Cosmopolitan resort’s grand opening, British sensation <strong>Florence and the Machine</strong> will kick off the pre-grand opening with an invitation-only event December 30; followed by a set from Tao/Lavo resident DJ Vice.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve acclaimed global superstar DJ <strong>Erick Morillo</strong> will begin his residency with the club’s grand opening. Morillo’s <em>Subliminal Sessions</em> residency promises to be a revolutionary clubbing experience. The futuristic, Tron-inspired, Vegas-style production takes full advantage of Marquee’s state-of-the-art stage, audio, lighting and video systems designed by Sennova Systems and V Square Labs. Says Morillo, <em>"I always say New Year's never lives up to its expectations, but honestly in my heart I really feel like this New Year is going to be the party of all parties. And if you're not going to be there, you're absolutely missing out!"</em> Expect Morillo to command the club’s 32,000-watt subwoofers with his signature sexy, full-bodied house music, adding a deeper twist as the early hours approach.</p>

<p>Closing out the weekend’s all-star line-up will be American sensation <strong>Kaskade</strong> headlining the party on New Year’s Day. His ensuing residency, Color Dream will invite clubbers to escape into a spectacular fantasy world with a rush of color and the most thrilling aural experience. Customized videos, graphics and lighting effects will immerse clubbers in a sublime fantasy world with DJs operating a cutting edge iPad application to trigger custom visuals, sound effects, club blackouts and cryogenics from behind the DJ booth. Says Kaskade, <em>“This is surely going to be one of the best clubs in the world and I am excited to be a part of it from the ground up. Vegas knows how to out do everyone and this will be no exception. This will redefine what a mega club is.”</em></p>
<p>This monumental 60,000 square-foot, David Rockwell-designed venue encompasses seven bars that transition patrons between three lavish rooms and variant musical experiences. The sound system at Marquee is a one-of-a-kind, custom-design by Sound Investment Audio with industry-leading Funktion One components, and a custom fabricated main dance floor area system.</p>
<p>Drawing focus in the Main Room is a 40 foot LED DJ booth and projection stage which is surrounded by plush coliseum-style banquette seating and two dance floors.  Overlooking the spectacular main floor is a lavish, Library style room offering an intimate lounge experience accentuated by a fireplace, a billiard table and vintage books whose contents delve into captivating Las Vegas history ranging from gambling to showgirls.  In tribute to the tradition of classic mixology, the Library’s drink menu will emphasize specialty cocktails with a modern twist.</p>
<p>Venturing further into the venue, club-goers will encounter the lower level Boom Box Room, an intimate boite with strip views and separate DJ; with a state-of- the-art sound system.</p>
<p>Beyond the main nightclub space, Marquee will debut the Dayclub portion of the venue in early spring. The Dayclub will showcase eight cabanas with individual infinity pools and 10 three-story bungalow lofts complete with living quarters and an open air party-deck.  The lavish adults-only outdoor facility will also feature inviting sun beds, a gaming area, two pools and daytime food menu from Tao Group’s corporate executive chef Ralph Scamardella, with a party fueled by world-renowned DJ talent.</p>
