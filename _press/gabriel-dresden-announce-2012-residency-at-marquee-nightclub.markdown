<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">America’s multi-award winning duo Gabriel &amp; Dresden are proud to announce their brand new residency at Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub in Las Vegas. Launching on February 3, the premiere event will feature a set from Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresdenthat spans the best parts of their history remixed and mashed up to their favorite new tracks. Sharing the stage with G&amp;D that night will be Jes, reigning Queen of Roctronica, who will perform many of her powerful anthems intermittently throughout their set. The trio of Gabriel, Dresden and Jes rose to prominence as Motorcycle and created 2003's biggest EDM hit "As The Rush Comes" and this night will be the first time they have performed together in more than seven years!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">"We are very excited to finally have somewhere to play consistently in Vegas. We've been coming to this city for many years both as Gabriel &amp; Dresden and as solo artists and there has never been a nightclub like Marquee. It's one of the most beautiful clubs we've seen with production and sound that will leave you breathless. " – Gabriel &amp; Dresden</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">The announcement of the Marquee residency comes at an exciting time for Gabriel &amp; Dresden. In 2011 the duo reunited after a three-year hiatus and toured the world playing in 17 different countries and many of the world’s best festivals. They released the double-mix CD ‘Mixed for Feet’ and their remix of Andain’s “Promises” was an international smash which lead to a brand new management and label deal with Armin Van Buuren’s Armada Music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">The deal with Armada Music, combined with the reactivation of their popular Organized Nature imprint, will allow Gabriel &amp; Dresden to have a steady stream of releases to unleash to the fans starting February 20 with new single "No Reservations"; their collaboration with Washington DC's up and coming bass crew Secret Panda Society. Plans are also being made to release a newly recorded version of "On A High" with the original singer Duncan Sheik. Of course, their reputation for finding and nurturing tomorrow's vocal stars will also continue unabated. Watch this space (or come to Marquee) and you'll agree!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ABOUT GABRIEL &amp; DRESDEN</strong></span><br />
Originally joining forces in 2001 – Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden – ascended through the dance music ranks at an astonishing pace. Within a year of officially teaming up they completed fourteen remixes ranging from big name dance artists like Tiësto, Paul and Oakenfold to crossover acts including Annie Lennox, Jewel and New Order. While remixing other artists would continue to be a big part of Gabriel &amp; Dresden’s studio work, it was their own original productions that would define them. With just one original single under their belt – 2002’s “Lament”- Gabriel &amp; Dresden’s most beloved original work arrived when they teamed up with singer Jes Breiden to form the group Motorcycle and produced 2003’s “As The Rush Comes.” The track went on to become Billboard’s year-end number one Dance Airplay track, reached number eleven in the UK Singles Chart and topped numerous other charts across the world in 2004.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr">With the success of their remixes and “As The Rush Comes,” Gabriel &amp; Dresden’s career was now in overdrive. In addition to non-stop tour dates across the globe and a steady rise in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll and the launch of their own Organized Nature label, their second mix CD, Bloom, was released and spawned the single “Arcadia.” In 2006, Gabriel &amp; Dresden’s self-titled artist album was released featuring the singles "Tracking Treasure Down" and "Dangerous Power.” This was followed by 2007’s Toolroom Knights, Vol. 2 and 2011’s “Mixed For Feet.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To date, Gabriel &amp; Dresden have produced 12 original tracks (including collaborations and as Motorcycle); released one artist album and three mix CDs; delivered 50 remixes; and reached #1 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Chart 18 times. They peaked at #20 on the DJ Magazine Top 100 Poll in 2005; won the 2004 DanceStar award for "Best Breakthrough DJ;" and received numerous awards at the IDMA’s including “Best Producers;” “Best Progressive / Trance Track” for "As The Rush Comes;" “Best Remixers; Best Alternative Dance Track for "Dangerous Power" and was twice named “Best American DJs” (2007 &amp; 2008).</p>
