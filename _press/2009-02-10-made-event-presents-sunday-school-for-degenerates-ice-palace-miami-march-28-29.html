<em><strong>*Powered by Integral Sound</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Sunday School For Degenerates</strong> graduates from [the now defunct] Pawn Shop to the expansive <strong>Ice Palace</strong> in downtown Miami. Now in its 4th year, SSFD continues to curate one the most exciting, international selections of underground techno artists for one of the most highly anticipated parties of the year. Every year, Sunday School brings together techno aficionados from all points east and west, along with a who’s who in the industry.  With multiple rooms of music – all night inside with outdoor terrace and all day in the outdoor garden complete with grassy lawn and palm trees, <strong>Made Event</strong> will design the raw space in time for winter recess, along with a complete sound system custom installed and engineered by the uncompromising <strong>Integral Sound</strong>. This will be a 24 hour madcap adventure that will top off the Winter Music Conference week for the professional clubber.</p>
<p><em>Sunday School</em> staple and NYC <em>Save the Cannibals</em> arch selector <strong>Adultnapper</strong> will be making his fourth appearance behind the DJ pulpit with his elaborate swung micro-rhythms, thick musical basslines, complex arrangements and haunting tonal melodies. Greece’s <strong>Argy</strong> makes his U.S. Debut, following last year’s acclaimed album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus On Argy</span> on Poker Flat. Also making his U.S. debut, <strong>Barem</strong> straight from Argentina, has been hailed as the top new, emerging minimal techno producer. Berlin’s Panorama Bar’s first lady of techno and <em>Save the</em> <em>Cannibals</em> high priestess, <strong>Cassy</strong> makes her sophomore appearance after a legendary closing set in 2007. French super producer and DJ extraordinaire <strong>D’Julz</strong> will be making a long-awaited comeback to Miami with his house and techno music rife with tribal, dub, and funk influences. Israeli producer <strong>Guy Gerber</strong> returns to SSFD and continues his hot streak with brilliant “Timing” release on <em>Cocoon Recordings</em>. Swedish <strong>Ida Engberg</strong> is Drumcode's secret weapon, bringing a touch of female finesse to a predominately male genre of hard techno. Dutch DJ/Producer <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> is on the verge of greatness with his astounding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 14</span> compilation with over 100 tracks deftly mixed on 2CDs to be released this Spring. Joris delivers expert technical mixing and a drift between deep afterhour grooves and maximal bombs. <strong>Marco Carola</strong> has emerged in the last decade to be one of Italy’s most influential exports of techno and electronic music, now with his own string of releases on <em>Minus</em> sub-label <em>2M</em>. <em>Intim Recordings</em> principal and <em>Save the Cannibals</em> chieftain, <strong>Martin Landsky</strong> is a globetrotting ambassador of the sound that bridges techno to funk, house to minimal, and a bit of everything in between.  He has long been one of the key figures in the circle of producers at <em>Poker Flat Recordings</em> with a penchant for deep music that includes twisty and funky elements.<em> Freude Am Tanzen</em> &amp; <em>Vakant</em> label mainstay, <strong>Mathias Kaden</strong>’s unique repertoire includes the funky, freaky rhythms enriched by African and South American percussions.</p>
<p>From Detroit’s techno scene, <em>Ghostly’s</em> <strong>Matthew Dear</strong> has evolved into a genre defying electronic music sensation. With his many production guises – Audion, Jabberjaw, and False, he continually pushes the envelope in the world of techno. Also a <em>Save the Cannibals</em> NYC resident, he is now set to release a brand new monthly series of Audion 12” releases, leading up to a new artist album slated for the summer. <em>Sunday School</em> headmaster <strong>Mr. C.</strong> has long been one of the original proponents of tech house with over 25 years of mixing vinyl. Turkish delight, <strong>Onur</strong> <strong>Özer</strong> is one of the most in demand DJs and producers on the continent, appearing here in his highly anticipated U.S. debut. With a string of massive releases, his music veers into mystical arabesque and turkish art music with deep synthetic pulses in his own unique style. Detroit son <strong>Ryan Crosson</strong> crafts techno and house tied to the historical precedent of his hometown, married with the new minimal aesthetics of his adopted Berlin. His acclaimed releases on diverse and groundbreaking labels like <em>Minus, Telegraph, Trapez</em>, and <em>Wagon Repair</em>, have vaulted him into the senior class. One of the brightest up-and-comers in the scene, Spectral Sound’s <strong>Seth Troxler</strong> move from Detroit to Berlin also continues to exemplify the mergence of his local roots with the European minimal techno and house aesthetic. With his debut “Love Never Sleeps” EP out now on <em>Crosstown Rebels</em> and <em>Save the Cannibals </em>NYC residency, this young prodigy is one to watch. <em>Diynamic</em> label boss, <strong>Solomun</strong> from the heart of Bosnia, has been hosting top nights in Hamburg at the famed DIY club. Also a <em>Diynamic</em> favorite, hotly tipped Hamburg producer <strong>Stimming</strong> will be playing live to proselytize his unique blend of highly melodic, emo-techno with tracks from his upcoming debut LP <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reflections</span>. Germany’s techno pioneer and minimal dance connoisseur, <strong>Steve Bug</strong> is one of the original <em>SSFD</em> principal members and <em>Save the Cannibals</em> resident. He is one of the scene’s unsung heroes and stands proudly at the helm of three influential labels - <em>Dessous, Audiomatique Recording</em>, and <em>Poker Flat</em>, now celebrating its 10 year anniversary with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All in! The Anniversary Compilation</span>.</p>
