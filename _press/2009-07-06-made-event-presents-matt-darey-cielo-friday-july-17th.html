<strong><em>@ Cielo</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the return of <em>Nocturnal Radio</em>’s trance pioneer <strong>Matt Darey</strong> to <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, July 17, 2009</strong></span></p>
<p>If break beats, electro rhythms, and titan trance grooves set your pulse racing, then look no further then <strong>Matt Darey</strong>, one of the genre’s leading exponents. A master at whipping up the tempo and fuelling the adrenaline with his incisive sets, selling over 2 million albums and singles in a near-20 year career. You might own copies of his ‘Euphoria’ trance series, or releases as Li Kwan, Tekara or Lost Tribe. Doubtlessly you’ll have heard his music in clubs alongside thousands of others on dancefloors from Tokyo to Sydney and London to Ibiza.</p>
<p>His <em>Nocturnal </em>radio show is the world’s fastest expanding multi-genre dance radio show now broadcast on 116 FM stations worldwide. The 2 hour weekly show covers the best new tracks from all genres of dance music including electro, progressive, house, breaks &amp; trance, along with special guest DJs.</p>
<p>Matt’s latest project is the rocktronica group <em>Urban Astronauts</em>.  With their 3 track EP available, it further proves Matt Darey as a talent who will not be labeled.  A sound that bridges the gap between House, Trance and Indie Rock, Urban Astronauts has already received play from the world’s top DJ’s and has landed on the airwaves of BBC Radio 1 for some time now.  Across the world and on the airwaves, Matt continues to push forward the sounds of dance music into new areas with his rock influenced productions and tours the globe with his own unique blend of music from many genres.</p>
