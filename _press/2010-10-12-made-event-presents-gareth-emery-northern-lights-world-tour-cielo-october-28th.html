<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents trance trendsetter<strong> Gareth Emery </strong>for an official stop on his ‘Northern Lights’ world tour at intimate dance boîte <strong>Cielo</strong> with AlterImage on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, October 28th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>British DJ/producer <strong>Gareth Emery</strong> is used to breaking boundaries. He was voted # 9 in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs 2009 poll—one of only a handful of DJs to crack the world’s top ten before the age of 30—and spent more time at the top of last year’s Beatport trance chart than any other artist. He spent the first six months of this year touring 30 different countries and playing to over a million fans as well to a sold-out capacity crowd at New York’s <em>Electric Zoo Festival</em>. His program <a href="http://www.garethemery.com/podcast/podcast_109/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Gareth Emery Podcast</span></a> is one of the most popular and influential dance music downloads in the world, with nominations for ‘Best Podcast’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference <em>IDMA</em> awards three years running. And now, the global dance music superstar is releasing his highly anticipated debut artist album, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Northern Lights</strong></span> on <em>Napith Music</em>, along with a full tour to give all a taste of its completely brand new tracks, a seamless mix through the worlds of house, trance, techno, and electro.</p>
<p>Gareth’s records, which are composed, produced and engineered entirely by him, are supported by the likes of Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold and Judge Jules. His club anthems like "Exposure" and "Metropolis" and remixes for Armin van Buuren, Above &amp; Beyond and Darude, have made <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Northern Lights</span> 0ne of the most anticipated dance music albums of the year. The album is a bright labyrinth of exotic and dynamic tracks and between soaring lazer-splicing synths he innovates his own unique style of progressive melodies and soothing vocals.  While the album comes complete with instant dance floor tracks like “Sanctuary”, Gareth constantly changes momentum; executing his classical piano education with vitality and fresh euphoric energy on “Too Dark Tonight” and “Fight The Sunrise”. Through “Stars” and “Citadel”, Gareth employs an endless array of synthetic elements and irresistible grooves, managing to inject not only home ambience but also arena filling presence.</p>
<p>The rest of the album contains a wealth of sublime vocal and instrumental cuts that defy genre, taking the listener seamlessly through the worlds of house, trance, techno and electro, demonstrating Gareth’s uniquely diverse style which makes him one of the most successful touring DJs in the world. <em>“The nice thing now is that most people who come and see me play know that it’s going to be quite varied, so they don’t come expecting a straight up set of one style only. I love meeting fans of mine who don’t really consider themselves trance fans,”</em> Gareth says. <em>“There’s a lot different styles on the album, but I don’t think this will surprise anyone who knows a bit about me.”</em> Get ready to meet Gareth!</p>
