Nick Warren is a true renaissance man by every definition of the word - DJ, Producer, Label Owner, Collaborator, it is his unwavering passion and drive for providing quality music that has allowed him to maintain a worldwide appeal, adored both underground and commercially from the very beginning of his long-spanned career. 2009 was a momentous year for Nick Warren as he successfully maintained one of the busiest tour schedules in the business, touring the world while carefully crafting new music. His dedication payed off as he became the 2nd highest climber in the prestigious DJ Top 100 to 58. As one half of one of the most successful production duos in the world <strong>Way Out West</strong>, Nick Warren along with Jody Wisternoff released their much anticipated fourth studio album, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We Love Machine</strong></span> on his own label Hope Recordings. The album was loved by fans and critics, deemed by many as one of the best dance albums of the year.</p>
<p>2010 will be yet another banner year for Nick Warren as he continues his unstoppable momentum. He is undoubtably at the pinnacle of his profession, continuing to pack venues with his current world tour, spreading his distinct blend of progressive house and cutting-edge techno. He is signed on to play two big name festivals this year - <strong>Way Out West</strong> is set to play the Glade Festival in Southeast England and Nick Warren will be headliner for the Dance Arena at Glastonbury Festival. He is also currently working on his solo single “In Search of Silver” and a "We Love Machine" remixes album, both due out this Spring 2010.</p>
<p>And so Nick Warren will continue his whirlwind jetsetting lifestyle. But if you’re lucky, you can catch him grace his iconic presence in New York City for one night, taking on the decks at Cielo for a special performance. Notorious for his instinctual ability to work the crowd, Nick Warren will build you up in an all-encompassing journey through a magical electronic soundscape - This is music for the people.</p>
