<strong>MAYOR AND PAXAHAU ANNOUNCE NEW INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT FESTIVAL PARTNERSHIP<br />
PLUS, MOVEMENT 2009 STAGE LINEUPS</strong></p>
<p>Mayor Kenneth V. Cockrel, Jr. and Paxahau officials announced during a press conference today for Movement 2009 a new international partnership between Movement Detroit and Movement Torino designed to expand the visibility of Detroit and its growing electronic music community.</p>
<p>“<em>This new partnership is historic</em>,” said Jason Huvaere, president of Paxahau.  “<em>We will work together to promote one another’s festivals and Paxahau will be instrumental in helping them book electronic music artists to perform at Movement Torino.”</em></p>
<p>World-renowned electronic music artist Derrick May developed the Movement brand that was used at the 2003 and 2004 festivals in Detroit.</p>
<p>Paxahau earned the right to produce the festival in 2006.  Huvaere said his team “made a conscious decision to maintain the consistency of the Movement brand” and struck an agreement with May to use it.</p>
<p>May wanted the Movement brand to have a global presence and eventually made an agreement with Movement Europe Limited to use it.  In October of 2006 the group from Italy hosted the first Movement Torino Music Event.  The web site is: <a href="http://">www.movement.it</a>.</p>
<p>Huvaere said May introduced the two groups in 2008 and they began discussing how to work together, which resulted in today’s announcement of the international partnership.</p>
<p>To kick-off the new partnership Movement Detroit and Movement Torino will co-host the Movement 2009 Closing Party at Plan B Night Club on Monday, May 25 in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>Movement 2009 is Coming to Detroit’s Hart Plaza May 23, 24, 25</strong><br />
Starting at noon on Saturday, May 23 Techno heads, House heads and electronic dance music enthusiasts from across the globe will pour through the turnstiles at Detroit’s Hart Plaza for the start of Movement 2009.</p>
<p>Electronic and dance music fans come to Movement because of Detroit’s rich Techno history and the great music played by the talented artists scheduled for each stage.  For three days and nights fans of the eclectic genre of music will have a chance to experience the ultimate outdoor electronic music venue. 36 hours of music; 4 stages and more than 70 artists and DJs.</p>
<p><em>"The national and international appeal of the Movement Festival proves that music is still one of Detroit's greatest assets,</em>" said Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr.  <em>“We expect Movement 2009 to attract a new wave of electronic music fans to Detroit for Memorial Day weekend.”<br />
</em><br />
<strong>Stage Sponsors, Headliners and Schedule Announced at Press Conference</strong><br />
During the 10 a.m. press conference at The Fillmore Detroit several components of Movement 2009 were discussed, but none were as important to electronic music fans as the artist lineups.  Announced for the first time were the names of the headliners for each of the four stages along with the release of the stage schedules.</p>
<p>“<em>Our stage lineup is one of the biggest announcements we make in the weeks leading up to the Movement festival,</em>” said Huvaere.  “<em>Electronic music fans want to know on which stage their favorite artist will be performing and on which day.” </em></p>
<p><strong>The Movement 2009 stage sponsors and headliners are:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Beatport Stage: Marco Carola</strong></em>; Guy Gerber; and Benny Benassi<br />
<em><strong>Made in Detroit Stage: Mike Huckaby</strong></em>; Anthony Rother; and Audion<br />
<em><strong>Red Bull Music Academy Stage</strong></em>: The Glitch Mob; Z-Trip; and Bassnectar<br />
<em><strong>vitaminwater stage</strong></em>: Carl Cox; Loco Dice vs. Luciano; and Derrick May</p>
<p><strong>Ticket Sales for Movement 2009 are Strong</strong><br />
Movement 2009 representatives are encouraging electronic music enthusiasts to take advantage of the discount presale weekend pass special.  Passes are only $40 for a limited time and can be purchased at www.paxahau.com.  VIP passes are also available for $150 each.</p>
<p>“<em>Ticket sales are more than double the number they were at this time last year,</em>” said Huvaere.  “<em>We are pleased that despite the tough economic times facing our country, people see the value in spending their Memorial Day Weekend in Detroit at the Movement Festival.” </em></p>
<p>As of Tuesday, April 28, 2009 some 1,789 weekend passes have been purchased for Movement 2009.  At the same time last year, only 838 weekend passes had been purchased for Movement 2008.  VIP ticket purchases are slightly up this year to 298 from 241 last year.</p>
<p>On average between 8,000 and 13,000 tickets are bought at the gate each of the three days of the festival.  Last year nearly 80,000 people passed through the turnstiles at Hart Plaza for Movement 2008.</p>
<p><strong>The Movement 2009 Experience</strong><br />
Electronic and dance music is the primary reason nearly 80,000 people packed Hart Plaza last year, but the producers of the festival strive each year to ensure they provide a well-rounded experience for those in attendance.</p>
<p>“<em>We know people come for the music, but many stay all day because of the atmosphere we are able to create on the festival-grounds,</em>” said Huvaere.  “<em>Our goal is to make it comfortable for our target demographic by partnering with organizations that they will appreciate and support both during and after the festival. </em></p>
<p>“Exposing festival-goers to Detroit and Michigan-based businesses and organizations by having them on-site either with a booth or as sponsors is important to us.”</p>
<p>The Movement festival will once again be “green” thanks to a partnership with Recycle Detroit and WasteOne Management.  Last year 3,000 pounds of recyclables were collected.  This year there will be improved efficiency at each of the recycling stations, which organizers hope will increase the amount of recyclable material collected.</p>
<p>A new partnership has been formed this year with the artisans from Handmade Detroit.  These talented locally-based artisans and crafters will be on-site selling their products.  It will be a great opportunity for them to introduce attendees from across the globe to the thriving creative community of Detroit.</p>
<p>Festival organizers have partnered again with Wheelhouse Detroit to offer Movement attendees a $5 discount on bike rentals throughout Memorial Day Weekend.  Wheelhouse is located just a short stroll down the RiverWalk from Hart Plaza, the site of Movement 2009.  Inside Detroit Tours &amp; Outings has also partnered with the festival to offer discounted walking tours of Detroit’s downtown to anyone with a Movement 2009 wristband.</p>
