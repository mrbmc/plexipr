<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents Finnish trance innovators <strong>Super8 &amp; Tab</strong> making their New York City debut at <strong>Cielo</strong> with Zack Roth on <strong>Thursday, February 24th</strong>. <strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Super8 &amp; Tab</strong>’s Miika Eloranta and Janne Mansnerus have been leading the Scandinavian trance revolution with their forward-thinking melodic sounds since 2005. Starting with breakthrough tracks “First Aid” and “Helsinki Scorchin,’” they’re now firmly established as the <em>Anjunabeats</em> label’s best selling artists behind Above &amp; Beyond. The duo has long been supported by the likes of Armin Van Buuren, Paul Van Dyke and Ferry Corsten, and are earning accolades like the IDMA Best Compilation (‘Anjunabeats Worldwide 01’), Beatport #1 chart positions and five star reviews in global dance bibles like Mixmag and DJ Mag with increasing speed and regularity. Super8 &amp; Tab’s 2010 debut artist album, <strong>Empire</strong>, which featured their signature deep, brooding vocal anthems, classy downtempo tracks, and futuristic trance fusions, went straight to #1 in the Finnish and #7 in the US iTunes dance charts on the day of its release. And the album’s latest single, “My Enemy,” has been in the Beatport Top 10 for almost two weeks since its release. <strong> </strong></p>

<p>Last month, the duo launched <strong>SuperTab Radio</strong>, bringing an hour of the freshest, most imaginative, cutting-edge trance and electronic dance music to radio stations and mp3 players around the world.
