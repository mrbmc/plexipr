<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">Cielo – May 2008 News</span></h4>
<p>Cielo's brand new 5 year anniversary compilation ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cinco</span>', mixed by residents Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff will now be released on Tommy Boy on July 8th. As you'd expect it's a sleek, sexy, soul-soothing mix featuring tracks by Carl Craig, Ultra Nate, Arnold Jarvis, Swayzak, Kenny Bobien, K-Scope and many more across 2 cds. At the end of the month, please join us for an exclusive ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cinco</span>' album release party on Saturday, May 31st.Since opening in 2003 Cielo has quickly become one of the most highly regarded clubs on the planet - and with more awards to its name in that time then any other nightclub including recently being voted "Best Club" of 2008 and "Best Party" 2008 at the Club World Awards. Roots resident Louie Vega underscores our achievements when he says: "<em>Cielo is the blueprint for the quintessential club of today. It captures New York City nightlife at its finest. Perfect sound, decor, atmosphere and a great crowd have made it a magical venue!</em>"</p>
<p>Right then, down to business and the May calendar shows exactly why Cielo is a multi-award winner with another cutting edge selection of visionary guest DJs to compliment our equally lauded residents.</p>
<p>Dance.Here.Now. our recent award winner in the Best Party category at the Club World Awards, sets the tempo nicely on the 1st with the arrival of the shining Mark Knight. The man behind the highly consistent Toolroom Records label has had a fantastic couple of years building his reputation as one of the UK's brightest new breed of DJs mixing big-room funky house with electro-etched grooves. "<em>I'm trying to push a fusion sound of techno-meets-house-meets-minimal, incorporating sounds and production techniques from each sub-genre to create something new</em>," says the man who obviously likes to defy pigeonholing.</p>
<p>Chateaux Flight, from Versatile Records in France, joins Willie Graff for his Play Time night on Friday the 2nd. The Parisian house duo of Gilbert Cohen and Nicolas Chaix (aka Gilb'r and I:Cube) are leading purveyors of the Gallic groove placing as much emphasis on diversity as on quality with their respective releases and DJ sets. A dreamy night of orchestrated electronica and beat-driven new wave is promised from the crazy Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Having launched his new and exclusive NYC residency last month, Junior Vasquez's Freedom party marches on in May with two sizzling hot nights of aural pleasure promised. Mark the 4th and 18th in your diary now for more Philadelphia Freedom from the legend that is Junior Vasquez.</p>
<p>If you're looking for sun-kissed grooves, and white island charm then Kiko Navarro's appearance on the 10th at Paradizo is an absolute must. For over a decade the Spanish DJ/producer has been creating eclectic and sensuous sounds that meld euphoric soulful house with organic Balearic grooves, supple electronic textures and percussive Afro-Latin rhythms leading to residencies at Pacha Ibiza, Pacha Mallorca and Neighbourhood for Buzzin' Fly London.</p>
<p>Fresh from being voted the #1 remixer of all time by DJ magazine, Carl Craig shows exactly why he's referred to as a master of all trades and a jack of none! His quarterly residency Demon Days, returns on May 15th and plays hosts to the Detroit native that many say is in a category all of his own. With a 20-year career spanning techno's most timeless album masterpiece (1995's ‘Landcruising'), countless classic singles, a string of acclaimed remixes and even an unwitting role in the formative alchemy of drum &amp; bass, this will be Craig's last U.S. DJ date until September!</p>
<p>Benji Candelario is a New York institution - his signature soulful house sound is the embodiment of his Manhattan upbringing during the culturally vibrant ‘70s and ‘80s, capturing the essence of the era and distinguishing him as a quintessential DJ, producer, remixer, and musician. Benji plays Paradizo on the 17th.</p>
<p>After last month's 5th year anniversary celebrations Francois K's Deep Space nights continues with the positive vibes in May with Mala of Digital Mystikz and Theo Parrish joining them on the 19th. South London's Digital Mystikz are forerunners in the burgeoning dubstep scene, while DC's Theo Parrish equally eclectic and uncompromising DJ sound should more then compliment proceedings.</p>
<p>Roots on the 21st finds Louie Vega and Kevin Hedge sharing deck duties with the legendary Tony Humphries. For an incredible four decades the Brooklyn-born DJ has helped in no small way to help shape the dance genre, and was a pivotal player and major influential in the house music movement in the ‘80s. His larger-then-life persona is still as key today as it was in those hedonistic and formative years.</p>
<p>Dance.Here.Now. promoter Benny Soto celebrates his birthday on the 22nd (and will also no doubt be raising a glass to further cheer collecting an award in the "Best Party" category at the Club World Awards) with the legendary Danny Tenaglia. On the heels of a fresh new single, "The Space Dance" and performing at the legendary Coachella Festival on the same bill as Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and Prince, Danny will be doing what he does best - getting back to business on the dancefloor. Happy birthday Benny!</p>
<p>The month rounds off with a visit from Italy's leading multifaceted techno DJ / producer Marco Carola with Willie Graff at the Made Event on the 30th. Marco's deep and seductive bleed of house, tribal and minimal techno has also seen him translate his live style onto vinyl recording for several key labels including Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 imprint.</p>
<p>As we mentioned at the start of the newsletter, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cinco</span>' our upcoming Tommy Boy Cielo compilation, is out shortly, and we'll be celebrating on the 31st with an album launch party hosted by the resident DJs and mixmasters of the album, Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff. The night promises your chance to sample key tracks from the album that also includes new music and remixes from the likes of Charles Webster, Nick Holder, Alix Alvarez, DJ Pippi, Justin Martin and Manoo &amp; Francois A.</p>
