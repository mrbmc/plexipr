<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cielo : March 2009 News<br />
Nominations for Club World Awards - Best Club, IDMA - Best US Club<br />
and DJ MAG - Top 100 Clubs of The World</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cielo</strong> is proud to announce nominations in three categories at the seventh annual <em>Club World Awards</em>. Having previously won the “Best Club” award three times before (in 2005, 2006 and last year), Cielo is up for the honor once more, as is <em>Dance.Here.Now</em> who similarly won the top prize last year in the “Best Party” category. Congrats also to <strong>Francois K </strong>nominated this year as “Best Resident” for his <em>Deep Space</em> night by the prestigious award show that’s generally regarded as the leader in its field. March madness continues with the upcoming Winter Music Conference and the 24th annual International Dance Music Awards being held in Miami, with Cielo nominated in the “Best US Club” category. To top off the accolades, Cielo will also be included in DJ Mag’s prestigious “Top 100 Clubs of the World” issue out later this month. Wish us luck and read on to see why we’re still on top.</p>
<p>Legendary disco remixer, label mogul, celebrated DJ and now <em>Club World</em> Award nominee for "Best Resident DJ", <strong>Francois K</strong>, kicks off a month of his seriously seductive Monday <em>Deep Space</em> nights on the 2nd with the dub poet <strong>Infinity</strong>. The Nyabinghi Rastafarian from Jamaica follows in the true tradition of dub poetry made popular by such artists as Mutabaruka, U-Roy and Big Youth. Just before the mayhem of the WMC, things kick off on the 23rd with<strong> Matt Edwards</strong> from <em>Rekid</em> and <em>Quiet Village</em> as our Deep Space guest. The innovative producer / remix has played a hand in hits for a plethora of artists in recent years including Benny Benassi, Kylie Minogue, Moby and Justice, while as a DJ his sets are pretty much like a box of chocolates: you never quite know what you’re gonna get!... Things round off on the 30th with guest <strong>John Daly</strong> (no not that one!) celebrating the launch of his upcoming ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sea &amp; Sky</span>’ opus on Francois’ <em>Wave Music</em> label. The Irish producer creates an opus that splits the difference between deep-house movers and serene electronic numbers with consummate ease.</p>
<p><em>Roots</em> finds <strong>Louie Vega</strong> &amp; <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> on deck duty at their weekly Wednesday soiree, no doubt road testing some past, present and future Miami classics from the Winter Music Conference. Just back from his 2009 Asian Tour, Louie flies solo on the 4th with the duo joined on the 11th by Detroit and Chicago house legend <strong>Ron Trent</strong>. The appearance launches his ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dance Classics</span>’ album with a set that will no doubt take in a selection of his own creations that have graced such pioneering labels as Peacefrog, Prescription and KMS… Next up for Roots on the 18th is vocal diva <strong>Anane</strong> and <strong>DJ Antonello Coghe</strong> joining our Master At Work for the annual <em>Unreleased Party</em> and launch night for <em>Nulu Music</em>. An abbreviation for Nothing Ultimately Leaves Us, the label’s founded on an ideology where anyone from anywhere can find, create and explore diverse musical genres… Finally Kevin Hedge welcomes <strong>Mr. V</strong>, the vocalist behind such hits as ‘Da Bump’ on Louie’s <em>Vega Records</em> imprint and ‘Put Your Drink Down’ on Defected, on Wednesday 25th.</p>
<p>He’s been in one of the most successful bands of the past 30 years, selling more than 70 million records, won countless awards and scored dozens of top 10 hits in the process. He’s <strong>Roger Taylor</strong>, drummer with Duran Duran, who with DJ partner <strong>Jake Fonique</strong>, headline "Do It In Heels" on Thursday 5th. “<em>It was during my ‘hiatus’ from Duran Duran in the ‘90s when I started working with Jake</em>,” recounts the dance fan that formed the electro house band Freebass at the time, and went on to release a number of techno records under the name Funkface. “<em>We kept in touch over the years, and kind of slipped into DJing. Just having fun, mixing our own tracks with other people’s music</em>.” After sell out dates last summer in Ibiza, the duo returns to New York to grace Cielo’s decks. Just don’t ask them to play ‘Wild Boys’!</p>
<p><strong>John Dahlbäck</strong> has been a fixture of the Swedish house scene since the age of 15. With his cousin Jesper they started the <em>Pickadoll</em> label and have worked with Laidback Luke, Robbie Rivera and Zoo Brazil, establishing themselves as producers to watch. John is special guest of the <em>Made Event</em> on Friday 6th when you’ll hear a sonic pastiche of lite techno, burbling electro and dream inducing house. As an artist, as well as DJ, he’s known for creating a slick and highly listenable oeuvre of rich textures, warm chords and electronic melodies that gel well, gliding freely without ever dipping in quality.</p>
<p>Australia’s <strong>Dirty South</strong> (aka Dragan Roganovic) caught the technically transmitted disease of DJing long before he even owned a set of turntables. Catching DJ sets by Erick Morillo and Felix Da Housecat when they came to his hometown of Melbourne reaping the rewards of international stardom. Fast-forward a handful of years and it’s now Dirty South’s turn to enjoy the limelight<em>. Dance.Here.Now </em>on Thursday 12th presents the Grammy nominated producer who’s worked with an equally varied array of artists including Axwell, Mark Ronson, Snoop Dogg, Tiesto and even the Doors.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 13th</strong> is <em><strong>Turntables On The Hudson</strong></em> with <strong>Mariano</strong>, <strong>Nickodemus</strong>, and <strong>Sabo</strong> taking care of business. Now into their eleventh year of throwing parties the guys return for their monthly residency of sultry jazz rhythms, Eastern melodies and Afrocentric grooves. The resident trio playing their adventurous musical mix built on a policy of maximum funk and absolute fun.</p>
<p>Almost a year since its inception, <strong>Dubfire </strong>and his burgeoning <em>Sci+Tec</em> label, are our special guests on Thursday 19th. The Deep Dish man and Grammy Award winner has always been at the cutting edge of dance, while as a DJ he’s known for creating an inspired and effervescent set, that builds on existing gargantuan grooves by adding a head swimmingly elaborate sound collages of crystalline electronica that really has to be heard on a large system to truly appreciate just how good it is.</p>
<p>Multitalented <strong>Tobi Neumann</strong> hails from Germany and caught electronica bug at the ‘95 Berlin Love Parade. Now an established trendsetter in his own right thanks to his refreshing cross-pollination of electro, techno and house, Tobi’s productions have graced such cutting edge labels as <em>Get Physical</em> and <em>Playhouse </em>and has worked with artists of the caliber of Chicks On Speed and Miss Kittin. Now signed to Sven Väth’s Cocoon agency, Cielo’s welcomes him on Friday 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Watt</strong>’s mixing is uncomplicated yet still slick, allowing the music to speak greater volumes than the DJ’s skills. A true quicksilver talent he creates a mixture of pizzazz and pathos that swings to a soulfully sophisticated pendulum. The man behind the revolutionary <em>Buzzin’ Fly</em> label, and the ‘90s the million selling Everything But The Girl, is special guest of Giantstep on Friday 27th. Edgy deep house grooves with the odd hint afro-beat, oozing elegance and panache is promised!</p>
