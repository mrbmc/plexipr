<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, May 5 – CALVIN HARRIS</strong><br />
The King of Electropop Calvin Harris is bringing his irresistibly infectious tracks to LAVO’s intimate dancefloor. A master of dance-pop tunes built from juicy staccato synths and squelchy electro basslines, Calvin’s hit anthems include “Acceptable in the 80s,” “The Girls” and “I’m Not Alone.” An in-demand producer and remixer, he has created hit tracks for Kylie Minogue, toured with Rihanna, collaborated with Dizzee Rascal, and remixed the likes of Cut Copy, The Ting Tings, Groove Armada, Katy Perry and Kelis. His debut album ‘I Created Disco’ (2007) reached gold status and latest album ‘Ready For The Weekend’ (2009) introduced his stadium-sized sound with massive riffs, big hands-in-the-air moments, and almost overnight the album reached #1 in the UK. Meanwhile, this NME Award winner is soon to release his third album, already giving fans a taste with “Awooga” and “Bounce” with Kelis out soon.</p>
