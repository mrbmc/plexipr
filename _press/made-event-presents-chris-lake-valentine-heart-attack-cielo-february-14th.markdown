<p><em><strong>Made Event </strong></em>presents New York City’s official <em><strong>Valentine Heart Attack</strong></em> featuring music by the one and only super producer and DJ extraordinaire <strong>Chris Lake</strong> along with <em>Pure Vibe</em> <em>NYC</em>’s <strong>Simon Heyliger</strong> &amp; <em>Elevator People</em>’s <strong>Alex Kofman</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunday, February 14th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Globally recognized as one of the most exciting, forward thinking and cutting edge producers working today, <strong>Chris Lake</strong> possess that rare ability to create music that fuses elements from around the dance music spectrum.   His house, techno, and electro tinged productions continue to receive overwhelming support from such scene luminaries as Sasha, Danny Howells, Sander Kleinenberg and Carl Cox.  Chris' original productions "One Too Many" and "Release" helped put his name on the dancefloor map, but it was his <em>Essential New Tune</em> smash, “Changes “ that catapulted his work into record boxes across the planet and turned the once underground buzz into a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
<p>These days Chris Lake has grown into a bona fide star of electronic dance music.   His global DJ tours take him to any number of destinations where he can be seen manning the DJ booth at the world’s best clubs and festivals, including New York’s <em><strong>Electric Zoo</strong></em>.  His label <strong><em>Rising Music</em></strong> has quickly become the benchmark for underground house with its celebrated releases and artist roster which includes the likes of Sebastien Leger and Deadmau5.  And of course there is the matter of Chris original productions and remixes.  Building on his reputation from “Changes”, his follow up “Carry Me Away” peaked at #1 on Billboard's Dance Chart leading the way for artists like Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue, Mark Ronson, Lily Allen, and Deadmau5 to request the Chris Lake remix treatment. With such an impressive resume in such a short time, Chris shows no signs of slowing down.   Demand for his unique sound and touch are higher than ever.  Catch a rising star in the intimate confines of Cielo dancefloor and superior Funktion One soundsystem.</p>
