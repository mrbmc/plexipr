<p>Dutch sensation <strong>Sander Van Doorn</strong> is taking over Vegas on February 4, 2011 for the launch of his new bi-monthly DJ residency at <strong>Marquee Nightclub and Dayclub</strong> at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Van Doorn’s residency will take clubbing to the next level with Marquee’s state-of-the-art, custom sound, lights, and visuals and integrated production.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Sander Van Doorn’s new residency takes full advantage of Marquee’s magnificent stage -- which includes a 40-foot LED wall, three-story catwalk, and costumed dancers -- to take clubbers on a journey through the genres of dance music including house, progressive, tech and trance. Dazzling custom-designed visuals interact with the music and progress throughout the different stages of his set. And Marquee’s custom sound system, featuring plush 32,000-watt subwoofers and full-range speaker clusters with perfect radial coverage, elevate the night into a full sensory experience. Says Sander, <em>“I’m incredibly excited to be one of the residents at Marquee. It’s taken all the best things about clubbing (sound, technology and space) and brought it all together perfectly. It’s a 10/10 and I can’t wait to get my hands on the decks! Las Vegas, here I come!”</em></p>

<p>Sander Van Doorn, recently voted #12 in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs poll, is one of the world’s most sought after DJ and producer. His sets and productions fuse elements of trance, electro, techno and house, uniting the dancefloor under his expertly woven SvD spell. His global touring schedule, remixes for the likes of Robbie Williams, The Killers and Depeche Mode, and headlining appearances at events like Creamfields, Mysteryland and Electric Zoo Festival have cemented his status as a leader in electronic dance music. Number one chart positions on each track released last year, and his immensely popular <em>‘Identity’</em> radio show on Sirius XM, continue to push the superstar’s stock into the stratosphere. His recent ‘Dusk Till Doorn’ compilation album, featuring a mix of progressive house to tech-trance, is now a global clubbing experience that has reached Europe, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East and Africa. This spring, Sander brings this wildly successful clubbing concept to Marquee for its U.S. premiere.</p>
