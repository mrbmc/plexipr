<p style="text-align: justify;">Take note house music fans – <strong>Soul Clap</strong> are coming to <strong>Dubspot</strong> on Monday, May 9th from 7:30-9:00pm EDT for a special music production and performance workshop. The workshop's physical space has been completely booked by the flood of RSVPs via <a href="http://t.ymlp69.net/usemwakahwwacabeqaaaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, but everyone can still tune in to the event live on the <a href="http://t.ymlp69.net/usemqadahwwaaabeqapaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank"><strong>Dubspot Blog</strong></a> via Ustream. All future workshops will also be available both in person (RSVPs in limited numbers) and online (for everyone, worldwide).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During their workshop, <strong>Soul Clap</strong> (Eli Goldstein &amp; Charles Levine) will demonstrate their collaborative workflow with Ableton Live and multiple performers / computers. The workshop will also feature a discussion on Soul Clap’s history and philosophies on production and DJing, leading to an interactive performance featuring five computers and five performers, two of whom will be Charlie and Eli. See them assign and program song parts such as drums, bass and lead, then jam out to create a track, and embody the ideas behind their music through the technology they use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check out this <a href="http://t.ymlp69.net/usemyafahwwavabeqalaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">download of Soul Clap’s “Lonely C”</a> that was recently featured on their DJ Kicks mix, created along with Wolf + Lamb.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About Soul Clap</strong><br />
Soul Clap have jumped into the spotlight of the house music community in recent years – a name eponymous with a slower tempo sexy vibe that has crept into the clubs, the charts, and top house labels through their stunning execution of sound. They made their way into playlists worldwide with remixes of Fleetwood Mac and Jamie Foxx, then slipped their own blends into the mix more recently with original (and unique) tracks like “Lonely C.”  Eli (Elyte) Goldstein Charles (Cnyce) Levine certainly understand the music – they have been honing their craft at clubs and parties for over a decade while living in Boston, MA. But they also seem to have their finger on the pulse of the market, and have quickly become one of the biggest sensations to hit the world circuit of DJ/Producers in the past year, with releases on Wolf + Lamb, Airdrop and Crosstown Rebels. Those releases helped Eli and Charlie find their way into the biggest sound systems around the globe – playing Fabric, The Marcy Hotel and Watergate in 2010. Next came two DJ mixes that were released last month: first a DJ Kicks mix with Wolf + Lamb that is getting high marks from the journalists, and “Social Experiments 002,” a party-centric mix for Toronto tastemaker Johnny White’s No.19 label.</p>
