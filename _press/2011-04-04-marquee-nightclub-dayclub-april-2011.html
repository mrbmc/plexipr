<p><strong>Friday, April 8 – SANDER VAN DOORN ‘DUSK TILL DOORN’ (U.S. DEBUT SHOW)</strong><br />
This month, Sander Van Doorn introduces the U.S. debut of his <em>Dusk Till Doorn</em> show at Marquee Las Vegas. The new production is named after his recent Dusk Till Doorn compilation album, which features a mix of progressive house to tech-trance. For the past six months, Sander and his team have been developing integrated sound and visuals for the spectacular production, which features Sander playing an extended set. Sander was recently voted #12 in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs poll, proving that he is one of the most sought after DJs and producers in the world. His sets and productions fuse elements of trance, electro, techno and house, uniting the dancefloor under his expertly woven SvD spell. His global touring schedule, remixes for the likes of Robbie Williams, The Killers and Depeche Mode, and headlining appearances at events like Creamfields, Mysteryland and Electric Zoo Festival have cemented his status as a leader in electronic dance music. Number one chart positions on each track released last year, and his immensely popular <em>‘Identity’</em> radio show on Sirius XM, continue to push the superstar’s stock into the stratosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, April 9 – ERICK MORILLO ‘SUBLIMINAL SESSIONS’</strong><br />
To take an excerpt from Erick Morillo’s tour diary: <em>“These parties are getting better each time!...I don’t know what it is about Vegas but it brings the best out of Erick.”</em> It could be Marquee’s huge, unrivaled LED panel displaying mind-blowing custom visuals behind the DJ booth, or the spectacular glow-in-the-dark dancers’ costumes that make Erick’s dazzling, futuristic, Tron-inspired residency, <em>Subliminal Sessions</em>, is such a huge success. Erick Morillo is the owner of <em>Subliminal Records</em> and a platinum-selling artist with a non-stop touring schedule, which includes legendary weekly summer parties at Pacha Ibiza and headline billing at many of the world’s top music festivals. His first dancefloor hit was in 1994 with Reel 2 Real’s ubiquitous “I Like To Move It.” Since then, he has developed a funky, soulful house sound, producing more hits like “Break Down The Doors,” “Live Your Life” (with Eddie Thoneick, featuring Shawnee Taylor) and remixes for Whitney Houston and Basement Jaxx, among others. Meanwhile, Subliminal Records continues to sign talented artists and deliver quality releases to the discerning dance music cognoscenti. Says Erick, <em>“What I love about Marquee is that we’re giving people a real festival show and experience inside of a club, and I’m so happy to be here doing a monthly residency.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Friday, April 15 – CHUCKIE ‘DIRTY DUTCH RED LIGHT DISTRICT’</strong><br />
Chuckie recently revealed his latest tribute to his <em>Dirty Dutch Red Light District</em> residency at Marquee: the <a href="http://t.ymlp51.net/ywjbaiajqqaaaqmavaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Diddy Dirty Money "I Hate That You Love Me" Chuckie Marquee remix</a>. Inspired by the dancefloor of his monthly Las Vegas residency, Chuckie rolls out his big, dirty house sound right from the start. Perfectly mixing rhythm and melody, he builds the track up with euphoric hooks and big room vocals before letting it explode in a concoction of huge drops and massive drums. It’s a taste of what Chuckie brings to Vegas every month: adapting Amsterdam’s iconic XXX logo, Chuckie’s team presents dazzling custom visuals and alluringly risqué dancers’ costumes to reflect the city’s daring, sophisticated and sexy style. Chuckie is the mastermind behind the Dirty Dutch phenomenon, famous for its addictive “house with an attitude influenced by hip hop” sound and global house music events. Chuckie’s monster tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” have been supported by the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Laidback Luke and Pete Tong. He has also remixed David Guetta and Bob Sinclar, among others, and has recently been spending time in the studio with the likes of T-Pain and Kelly Rowland. His busy touring schedule also includes playing headlining sets at some of the world’s biggest festivals as well as a monthly rotation on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ show.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, April 16 – KASKADE</strong><br />
Kaskade’s Marquee Las Vegas residency, attended by the likes of Paris Hilton and company, invites clubbers into a spectacular fantasy world, full of beautiful ballerina dancers and thrilling trance, house and pop music, as he indulges his every brilliant artistic impulse and keeps everyone packed on the dancefloor. Kaskade recently lent his chops to an old-school electro remix of Daft Punk’s “Rinzler” for the ‘Tron: Legacy R3CONFIGUR3D’ official remix album. Kaskade’s soul-lifting electronic music and unmatched versatility have recently earned him International Dance Music Award nominations for ‘Best American DJ (North America),’ ‘Best Full Length DJ Mix,’ ‘Best Artist (Solo)’ and ‘Best Progressive Track’ for “Fire in Your New Shoes” feat. Dragonette. With an IDMA ‘Best Remixer’ Award already under his belt as well as a spot in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs, Kaskade also has several number one iTunes singles and earned headline billing at major music festivals around the world. 2010 saw the release of his sixth artist album Dynasty, which debuted at number 4 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart, as well as the ‘dance.love’ mix compilation.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, April 22nd - MATT DAREY</strong><br />
Matt Darey returns to Marquee to deliver his eclectic brand of progressive house and trance. Ths groundbreaking DJ  is credited as one of the original podcast pioneers of the global dance scene, with over 500,000 subscribers to his weekly podcast and an estimated 3 million listeners tuning into his syndicated radio show, ‘Nocturnal,’ which consistently showcases his unapologetic blend of electro, progressive house, breaks and trance. Since the start of his career in electronic dance music, Matt has sold over an astonishing two million albums and singles with numerous top 10 and top 20 chart hits. He is a part of a new kind of electronic artist that cross-pollinates the subgenres of dance much like Morgan Page, Armin van Buuren, Above &amp; Beyond, Kaskade, Nervo, and Sharam to name a few. Matt has proven to be a chameleon of sound, producing a variety of releases from breaks to house to trance and progressive to experimental and his ground breaking genre of rocktronica. Matt's radio shows are a true eclectic journey which has been made tangible with his most recent Nocturnal, double mixed CD, available now on Black Hole Recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, April 23 – MARKUS SCHULZ</strong><br />
Markus Schulz’s exclusive Marquee residency has cemented his love affair with Vegas, building upon his impressive ‘Las Vegas ‘10’ compilation - a deep and electrifying ode to the city. Paired with Marquee’s custom sound system, spectacular LED visuals and dazzling dancers, Markus’ dark house grooves, trance melodies and “big, dark dirty basslines” is something you have to see to believe. “I love playing in Las Vegas and I think Marquee is one of the most impressive additions to come to the scene there since the turn of the Millennium,” he says. Over the last 10 years, Markus Schulz has fused the individual musical identities of progressive house and trance into his own inimitable sound. His weekly headlining DJ sets in front of many tens of thousands, prominent Global DJ Broadcast radio show listened to by tens of millions, and chart-topping releases on his own <em>Coldharbour Recordings</em> label have revolutionized the U.S. trance scene. In 2008, Schulz punched his way into the Top 10 of DJ Magazine’s Top 100 chart and has remained there ever since. This month, Markus Schulz released the Do You Dream? The Remixes album, a follow up to his critically acclaimed third artist album by the same name, featuring unique interpretations from top artists Cosmic Gate, Ferry Corsten, Super8 &amp; Tab and many more.</p>

<p><strong>Monday, April 25 – REDFOO OF LMFAO &amp; SPECIAL GUEST AVICII ‘PARTY ROCK MONDAYS’</strong><br />
“Drink, Dance and Party like everyone’s watching!” is Redfoo’s motto for his <em>Party Rock Mondays</em> residency at Marquee. If blow-up zebras, go-go dancers in blinged-out neon party gear, and electrifying vocal performances are any indication, Redfoo is a man of his word. Bringing the hottest electro house beats to Marquee every month, this Grammy-nominated DJ takes partying to the next level each time. Redfoo has worked with industry’s best, including David Guetta, the Black Eyed Peas, Lil Jon and Pitbull, and produced hit remixes of Kanye West’s “Love Lockdown,” Katy Perry’s “Hot N Cold” and more. Joining him is Avicii, who returns after destroying Marquee’s dancefloor last month with his unique house sound. Avicii recently won the International Dance Music Award for Best Breakthrough Solo Artist, which comes as no surprise, as Tiesto already named him Breakthrough DJ/Producer of 2010 in DJ Mag. Avicii has stamped his sound on remixes for Bob Sinclar, Dizzee Rascal, Sophie Ellis Baxter, Little Boots and David Guetta, and has collaborated with Tiesto, Sebastian Ingrosso from Swedish House Mafia and many more. His track “Seek Bromance” is a gold-selling radio sensation, while his remix of Armin van Buuren’s “Drowning” is currently one of the most sought-after house tracks in the world. His official remix for Daft Punk’s “Derezzed” is also out this month on the ‘Tron: Legacy R3CONFIGUR3D’ remix album.</p>
