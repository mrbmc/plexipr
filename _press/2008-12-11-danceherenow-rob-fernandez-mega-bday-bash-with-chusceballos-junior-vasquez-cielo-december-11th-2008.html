</strong></p>
<p>Join us on Thursday, December 11th as we celebrate the birthday of the Grand Poohbah of NYC nightlife Rob Fernandez with internationally renowned Spanish DJ duo <strong>Chus&amp;Ceballos</strong>, NYC dance music legend <strong>Junior Vasquez </strong>and up-and-coming Pacha NYC resident <strong>Pauley Raffaele</strong>. A ubiquitous figure on the nightlife scene, Rob has been one of the primary movers in the Big Apple's nightlife scene since the '80s, creating and producing some of the city's definitive events and longest-running weekly parties. In any given week, he can be seen overseeing the parties at the Club World Awards "Best Superclub" Pacha New York, at the Dance.Here.Now. parties along with Benny Soto at "Best Club" Cielo, and the over-the-top Sunday soiree and award recipient of "Best Party"- Asseteria.</p>
<p>Always imitated, never duplicated. There's nobody quite like Rob Fernandez. He began his illustrious nightlife career as a bar back, then serving as doorman at the legendary Sound Factory Bar for five years, and also helping to launch DJs like Danny Tenaglia (Be Yourself at Vinyl) and Erick Morillo (Subliminal Sessions) into international super-stardom. His marketing prowess is born of street cred and his uncanny sixth sense ability to recognize up-and-coming DJs and mold them into tomorrow's superstars on one of the world's biggest stages - New York City, puts him in a league of his own. Thank you Rob Fernandez! New York City nightlife will never be the same again.</p>
