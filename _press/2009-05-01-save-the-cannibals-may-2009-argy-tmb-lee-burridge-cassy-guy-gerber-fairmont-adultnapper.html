<p>May is an exciting month, delivering longer days, warmer weather, and the harbinger of summer. What better way to embrace these changes than to heat up the night with the world's best underground music!<strong> Made Event </strong>brings you New York's finest weekly techno dance event on its premiere custom I<strong>ntegral Sound</strong> system. Bringing talent down from the Bronx, and from as far away as Israel, Berlin, and London, Saturday nights at <strong>Rebel</strong> in Manhattan will be the ultimate destination to <strong>Save the Cannibals</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>MAY 2 - THE MARTINEZ BROTHERS &amp; ARGY with FILSONIK</strong><br />
Bronx teenage phenoms<strong> The Martinez Brothers</strong> (aka TMB as they’re affectionately called) have been causing a quite a hubbub and justly so for their seamless ability to honor everything from garage house, mash-ups and minimal bleeps in their charismatic, high-powered DJ sets. After having previously teamed up with <strong>Argy</strong> on their latest release on Objektivity, “Debbie Downer/Where Is Mr Brown”, the team reunites to recreate the magic. Argy, hailing from Greece, has been influenced early on by the US house scene, and now more recently by the deep dance floors of Berlin's Panorama Bar. These subtle influences can be heard peppered throughout Argy's countless productions on many of techno's tops labels right now, including his back-catalogue of releases and remix on last year’s scintillating Focus on Argy on Poker Flat Recordings. <strong>Filsonik</strong>, also an Objektivity cohort, will be warming things up right in the spirit of deep.</p>

<p><strong>MAY 9 - LEE BURRIDGE with MATTHEW DEKAY</strong><br />
For his StC debut in February, <strong>Lee Burridge</strong> took the cannibals by storm and left the dancefloor full of casualties stunned with an incredible night of manically-charged, forward-thinking music. His uncanny ability to mastermind the dancefloor and indiscernibly blend together funky house, tech-house and techno, never fails to move the mind &amp; body for a twisted tech-funk affair. There’s a special connection that Lee has forged with New York City and when he returns once again to rule the roost at Cannibals, it’ll be one special night.</p>

<p><strong>MAY 16 - CASSY with NIKOLA BAYTALA</strong><br />
Cannibals resident <strong>Cassy</strong> returns to New York after another monumental closing set at Sunday School For Degenerates that will be remembered as one of the year’s best. Cassy, known for her all vinyl sets and unmatched classic house catalog, is steadfastly becoming one of Berlin’s greatest exports. Her deep, hypnotic, and classy sounds are all things best experienced on New York's finest Integral Sound system. Also making his return to New York is one of San Francisco’s true musical treasures <strong>Nikola Baytala</strong>.  He has carved his own niche in the urban underground scene with credentials that include 10 years of DJing, a successful weekly at The Top hosted by his collective S.W.A.T. and the techno-oriented Kontrol parties. With a slew of signature tracks produced on labels such as Large, Tummy Touch, Nightshift, Soul Food, and Robsoul, Nikola has cemented his status and widely recognized for his distinctive style.</p>

<p><strong>MAY 23 - GUY GERBER (LIVE) with DENNIS RODGERS</strong><br />
Israeli’s own ambassador of electronic music,<strong> Guy Gerber</strong> brings forth his personal vision of techno, which he intertwines with unique and cleverly designed melodies and moving airs that leave no listener indifferent. He has been stirring up electronic audiences with his anthem releases, and his live shows have a distinctly fresh and distinguished sound. His Bedrock Records breakout “Stoppage Time” and unique melodies and production skills, led to Guy joining the Cocoon family. The a steady of Cocoon releases, “This Is Balagan”, “Sea of Sand”, collaboration with Shlomi Aber and now new single, “Timing”. Guy's own self imprint Supplement Facts, is considered to be one of the fast growing choice labels around and is Guy’s diplomatic means of communicating his passion for harmony and rhythm. For the rest of the night all good thing start and end with Robots <strong>Dennis Rodgers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>MAY 30 – FAIRMONT (LIVE) &amp; ADULTNAPPER</strong><br />
Save the Cannibals resident <strong>Adultnapper</strong> emerges from Francis Harris' imagination and his shadowy lair deep in Brooklyn.  After touring with Carl Cox and opening for Victor Calderone, Harris returns with a focus on his labels, the enigmatic Ransom Note label featuring the deeper side of Adultnapper alongside contemporaries; Alexi Delano, Camea, Matt Tolfrey &amp; Inxec. Later this Spring keep an ear out for 'Ransom Note Part Four: Theodor Zox “Falling” b/w “Tell Me”' with a Vincenzo Remix, plus digital exclusive bonus track “Momentum”. On the other tip, Ransom Note’s sub-label Footnote exposes the raw house side of Adultnapper's world with the latest release by Jay Tripwire “Indigo” with remixes by Touane and “Duel” by Jay Tripwire out now.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, <strong>Fairmont</strong>‘s Jake Fairley takes his music and shows a focus on stretching minimal techno into pop. Making his name as a techno maverick, Fairley has produced almost 30 records in total, 100+ songs and 4 LPs. His artist album 'Coloured In Memory' released on James Holden’s influential Border Community imprint last year, united Fairley's trademark driving analogue machine-funk with woozy, warm interludes, intimate vocals and drugged-out highs, fused with a touch of the experimental. The once elusive Fairmont’s softer side had been transformed into a serious club concern, and the everlush melodies are now imbued with a new dancefloor sensibility with his live reputation growing as a sweaty, raw performer imbued with tripped out liquid melodies</p>
