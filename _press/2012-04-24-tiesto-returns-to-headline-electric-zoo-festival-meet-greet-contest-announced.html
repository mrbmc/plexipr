<p>The world-renowned <strong>Tiësto</strong> will be returning to <strong>Electric Zoo Festival</strong> again in 2012, with the headliner spot on <strong>Sunday, September 2nd</strong>.</p>
<p>Tiesto recently told MTV News: <em>"It is an awesome festival in one of the most incredible settings in the world. How often do you get to play with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop? It is a special experience, being in the middle of a city with such a huge, energetic crowd. If you'd told me this would be possible 10 years ago, I wouldn't have believed you."</em></p>
<p>His closing peformance the first day of Electric Zoo 2011 was an epic occasion, see the footage by watching <a href="http://t.ymlp243.net/ubssjaramwsuakaubyaxaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">In The Booth - Episode 8</a>,Tiësto's all-access YouTube series (footage starts at 6:13). Said Tiësto after his set, <em>“Electric Zoo was sick! The crowd was unbelievable and brought an incredible energy to the city.”</em></p>

<p>There is plenty to promise that 2012's performance will be even better. <strong>Tiësto</strong> recently released the track “We Own The Night” with <strong>Wolfgang Gartner</strong>, an internationally renowned DJ/producer in his own right, who will be also playing at Electric Zoo this year (on Saturday, September 1st). Says Tiësto of his collaborator, <em>“I've been a huge fan of Wolfgang for years. As a producer, there are few out there with the kind of talent he has, so teaming up was always something I was very keen to make happen."</em></p>

<p>Following on the heels of “We Own The Night” is Tiësto’s new CLUB LIFE – Volume Two Miami mix album, released on his own <em>Musical Freedom</em> imprint and available Tuesday, April 24th. Tiësto's personal productions and remixes are a driving force behind this mix. In addition to "We Own The Night" he is also behind the original productions "Chasing Summers" and "Make Some Noise," created with the Russian trio Swanky Tunes. Remixes included are of Coldplay’s "Paradise," Gotye’s international chart topper "Somebody That I Used To Know," The Naked &amp; Famous' indie anthem "Young Blood," which was remixed alongside the Dutch star Hardwell, and Afrojack's latest hit "Can't Stop Me Now."</p>
<p>The <strong>Electric Zoo Festival</strong> and Tiësto are also happy to announce a special <strong>Electric Zoo Meet &amp; Greet Contest</strong>. Two lucky fans, plus two of their friends, will get to meet the superstar DJ before his set. Details of the Meet &amp; Greet Contest will be posted on the <a href="http://t.ymlp243.net/ubsshaoamwsualaubyanaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Electric Zoo Facebook Page</a> closer to the event, so be sure to check back for updates.</p>

<p><strong>About Tiësto</strong><br />
Tiësto needs little introduction. With a list of achievements ranging from a Grammy nomination, multiple MTV awards, performing at the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens (first ever for DJ to do so), the largest solo DJ headline performance in US history, and the accolade of "The Greatest DJ Of All Time" by Mixmag, there is no doubting his legendary status. He has reached almost 12 million fans on Facebook, garnered over 1 million followers on Twitter, and tallied well over 300 million views on YouTube. To better connect with fans, Tiësto became the first artist to ever live-stream a concert on Twitter, and produced his acclaimed 10-part "In The Booth" YouTube documentary series, plus a state-of-the-art mobile app for iPhones and iPads. He has also just launched his very own Sirius Channel - Club Life Radio. His label, Musical Freedom, will release his anticipated mix album CLUB LIFE – Volume Two Miami on April 24th as he continues 2012 with a packed tour schedule that touches down everywhere from Tijuana, Chicago, Las Vegas, Barcelona, to New York.</p>
