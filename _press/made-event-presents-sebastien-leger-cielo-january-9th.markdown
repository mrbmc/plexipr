<strong>Made Event Presents<br />
Sébastien Leger</strong><br />
<strong>w/ Sleepy &amp; Boo</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the highly anticipated return of French DJ/Producer/Remixer extraordinaire,<strong> Sébastien Leger</strong>, at <strong>Cielo</strong> on Friday, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>January 9th, 2009</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the last decade <strong>Sébastien Léger</strong> has become one of France's most revered DJ/producers. Eschewing the more obvious French filter house clichés his productions have taken on the robust dancefloor edge of his beloved Chicago house heroes and twisted them into his own electronic masterpieces. Léger continues to remain focused on developing his own sound via his own imprint Mistakes Music that is indelibly stamped with his trademark electro, techno-funk sound. The label has gone from strength to strength across the last few releases culminating in the superb David West and Inkfish release and with the latest "Majestic EP". The stunning EP contains two new Léger originals "Majestic" and "Majuro" and a remix by Deadmau5 of one of Sebastien's older hit tracks "Bad Clocks." On the horizon, be on the lookout for a new original Léger track with a Marilyn Mansion sample to be released on Pryda Recordings with additional remix duties by Eric Prydz. Leger is also continuing work on the remixer front with his remix of Deadmau5's track "SLIP" out this month on Mau5trap Recordings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Parallel to building his international DJ career Sébastien Léger is currently working on a new live show. As a consequence of his continued progression in his production work, the great variety of house music colour in his tracks, the construction and arrangement of his electro and funk-infused rhythms, the now Amsterdam based Sébastien Léger is poised at the forefront of the global electronic movement.</p>
