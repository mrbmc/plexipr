<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">2007 marks the 10th anniversary of the now world renowned, cutting edge label - Subliminal Records and this Thanksgiving Eve, November 21st, Erick Morillo returns to New York City for a very special Subliminal Sessions party at his home club, Pacha NYC. To celebrate Erick has invited special guests along, who will be performing some of Subliminal's biggest tracks to highlight the last ten fantastic years.</span></p>
<p>Erick shares his excitement, "It's going to be awesome; I hope you're all as excited as I am. I can't wait to get all the Subliminal family back for our own Thanksgiving celebration, as we all know the holidays are all about spending time with family."</p>
<p>Abigail Bailey will be performing "I Just Can't Get Enough" the track she wrote with Herd &amp; Fitz in 2005 and which reached #11 in the UK Top 20.  It went on to become an across the board radio smash and still gets rocked out at parties across the globe. Abby always brings the house down at the Subliminal parties and has an unbelievable performance in the Subliminal Arena as this year's Creamfields UK. It will be a show stopping Pacha NYC debut.</p>
<p>Gadjo's "So Many Times" was the track that defined the WMC in 2004 and was one of that  summer's biggest anthems. It still sounds just as fresh nearly four years on and Alexandra Prinz is jetting over from Germany for a special live performance.</p>
<p>From the latest installment in the Subliminal Records compilation series, Subliminal Sessions 11 mixed by label head, Erick Morillo himself, the track that garnered the most attention is Lee Kalt's ‘Special K' featuring Missus M. Missus M will be performing a live performance of this hit 2007 tune and Lee Kalt will be DJ'ing in the Pacha basement.<br />
