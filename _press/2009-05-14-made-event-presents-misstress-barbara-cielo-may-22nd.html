<em>Made Event presents<br />
</em></strong><strong>MISSTRESS BARBARA<br />
<em>@ Cielo</em></strong><em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> transports the Canadian star <strong>Mistress Barbara </strong>as she graces us with her light on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 22nd</strong></span> at <strong>Cielo</strong>.</p>
<p>Not afraid to expose her vulnerable side, <strong>Mistress Barbara</strong> speaks out her heart and soul as she embarks on a whole new adventure with the release of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I’m No Human</strong></span>, her first album as a songwriter out on <em>Maple Music Recordings</em> in May 2009. One of the most remarkable aspects is that the album sees Barbara herself on vocals. Lush melodies overlay her minimalist beats accompanied her intoxicating femme fatale voice unraveling a happy development born out of unhappy circumstance.</p>
<p>The album is her most personal to date and inspired from a personal loss in the family, the passing of her late father.  “<em>I know he would be very, very proud.  He played guitar, violin, piano,</em>” Barbara says. On recording violins in the studio, she adds, <em>“I had tears in my eyes. He would be so happy. </em></p>
<p>Pouring out her feelings in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I’m No Human</span>, Barbara shines on through a cover from <strong>Leonardo Cohen</strong>’s “Dance Me To The End of Love” on the album;  <em>“Everything in my life is for love. I do everything for love and I undo everything for love.”</em> Additional contributions from <strong>Sam Roberts, Brazilian Girls</strong> and <strong>Bjorn Yttling </strong>of Peter Bjorn and John.</p>
