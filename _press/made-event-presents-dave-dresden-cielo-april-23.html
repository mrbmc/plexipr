@ Cielo</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents dance music renaissance man <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> as he returns to <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, April 23rd, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> has had his hands full in all aspects of the dance music industry.  Starting as a music journalist and radio host, Dresden was an instrumental figure in introducing some of dance music’s biggest names to American audiences during the 1990’s.  Now known as a DJ/Remixer/Producer/Collaborator extraordinaire,  Dresden has recently formed his second trailblazing collaborative project - Dresden &amp; Johnston.  Responsible for some of the biggest and most recognizable club hits of the last decade, Dave Dresden continues to show the passion for music which brought him to the apex of the industry.</p>
<p>In 2001 Dresden partnered with Josh Gabriel and formed the DJ/production duo, Gabriel &amp; Dresden. Shortly after, the duo gained international recognition by way of their remix work on tracks from Tiesto, Way Out West, and Above &amp; Beyond, as well as more pop influenced tracks from Dido and Jewel. During the duo’s time together they amassed 18 #1 positioned singles and remixes on Billboard's Club Play Chart including the worldwide smash "As the Rush Comes".  By 2007 the duo was recognized by the IDMA’s as Best U.S DJ’s, and then again the following year.</p>
<p>As a solo artist, Dresden's exhibited the same determination he possessed during the early stages of his career and has successfully remixed work from a wide spectrum of artists from The Killers, Annie Lennox and Sarah McLachlan to Paul Oakenfold, Madonna, and Radiohead.  Now, he has formed a new collaborative project with former Mephisto Odyssey frontman Mikael Johnston.  Already releasing several successful remixes for the likes of Lily Allen, BT, and Crystal Method, Dresden &amp; Johnston are now hard at work on their first full length album which is set to be released in 2010.  Their single “Keep Faith” will be released on April 13th and has already received much positive feedback at this year’s Winter Music Conference.  The duo is also set to unveil a new live show incorporating elements of DJing, remixing, and live instrumentation in support of their new material.</p>
