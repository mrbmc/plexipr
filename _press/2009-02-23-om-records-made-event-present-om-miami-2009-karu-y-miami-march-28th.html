The combined line-up of world renowned DJ’s and LIVE Artists, each with their own internationally recognized discography, truly embody the most credible and sought after talent on the dance/electronic/hip-hop music circuit.</p>
<p>Founded in 1995 and born amidst the funky underground music scene in San Francisco, Om Records has released over 250 releases, including both artist albums and various compilations. While Om Records remains renowned for its signature funky house and deep house sounds, the newest subsidiary imprint Om Hip Hop represents a bold leap into the future of urban music, as well as a return to its parent label’s early roots. Today, Om continues its mission to source, release and promote music that is refined, innovative and always pushing boundaries.</p>
<p>The breathtaking and opulent Karu &amp; Y is located in the heart of Miami’s expanding arts and entertainment downtown district. The newly re-opened 42,000 square foot venue, provides the ultimate entertainment playground with a few Zen twists. From the entryway’s signature waterfalls, enter into the vast layout of 5 distinct areas, including the Y Ultralounge and Garden, the newly dubbed Champagne Lounge, and Buddha Club with its far east inspired décor, stretching out onto the outdoor Buddha Gardens with its flowing river, white tented cabanas and lush greenery. Immerse yourself in this ultra-trendy, sleek nightclub with today's and tomorrow's biggest dance music stars.</p>
