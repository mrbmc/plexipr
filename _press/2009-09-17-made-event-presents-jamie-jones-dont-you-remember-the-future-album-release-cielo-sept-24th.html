<strong><em>Made Event presents</em><br />
JAMIE JONES<br />
<em>'Don't You Remember The Future' Album Release Tour</em><br />
with Orchard Lounge<br />
@ Cielo</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents groove master <strong>Jamie Jones</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, September 24, 2009</strong></span>. There are some talents that remain inconspicuous and then there are some you canʼt ignore. Jamie Jones is the latter, quickly rising to superstar status in underground dance circles over recent years. Releases on <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Get Physical</em> and <em>BPitch</em> have catapulted him to become a cult figure and he is widely admired for his true originality.</p>
<p>From his debut single "Amazon", to his latest anthem "Summertime", his unique sound has won him worldwide audiences and this album has been widely anticipated as one to change the face of the current house music spectrum.</p>
<p>With his debut LP ʻ<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Donʼt You Remember The Future</span></strong>ʼ, Jamie Jones delivers an album of  “intergalactic techno house, where old school prince meets cybertron.” A seamlessly blended up-tempo mix filled with eerie and energetic moments.</p>
<p>Featuring ten brand new tracks from Jamie Jones, alongside this year's dancefloor anthem "Summertime" and the current "Galactic Space Bar" - which features the vocals of Egyptian Lover - the albumʼs twelve tracks are stitched together in an entangled web of beats and bleeps, available digitally as separate edits.</p>
<p>“<em>The concept of the album is the idea that this is the year 2116, when music has  become some kind of controlled means of manipulating humans, and the rebellion consists of artist like myself who are hiding underground creating sounds that  explore outside that control.</em>” Jamie Jones</p>
<p>Jamie Jones has achieved in a few short years what some strive for in a lifetime. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ʻDonʼt You Remember The Futureʼ </span>marks the next step in his journey, becoming an artist to be remembered and one that has brought the future into the present.<br />
<em> </em></p>
<p><em>ʻDonʼt You Remember The Futureʼ is out now on Crosstown Rebels.</em></p>
