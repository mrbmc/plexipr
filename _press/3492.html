<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, July 28 - CALVIN HARRIS</strong><br />
In recent years, Scotland's Calvin Harris has established himself as the indisputable King of Electropop, and with huge international hits like "Acceptable in the 80s," "The Girls" and "I'm Not Alone," confirmed himself as one of the world's most in-demand producers. Rocking the clubs and charts alike since his gold debut album 'I Created Disco' was released in 2007, Calvin has collaborated with the likes of Rihanna, Dizzee Rascal and Kylie Minogue, and remixed Cut Copy, The Ting Tings, Groove Armada, Katy Perry and Kelis. His highly anticipated 3rd artist album is soon to be released, with singles "Awooga," "Bounce," and "Feel So Close" already exciting fans worldwide. "Feel So Close" also has a hot new video just released this month with already over 1.4 million views, and a selection of remixes by the likes of Nero, Benny Benassi, and Dillon Francis set for release on August 21st.</p>
