<em>The Grammy award winning Italian superstar drops in for 60mins of non-stop bombs! </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> proudly presents two titans of electro: the return of resident DJ <strong>Benny Benassi</strong> and debut of special guest<strong> Steve Aoki</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 21st, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For more than two decades the pulsating dirty, sweaty and smooth sound of Italian DJ/producer <strong>Benny Benassi</strong> has been electrifying crowds with his techno-tinged house jams and remixes. His first club hit, “I Feel So Fine” (released under the name KMC, feat. Dhany), reached #1 on the UK charts in 2001. In 2003, his solo debut album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hypnotica</span>, featuring the worldwide mega hit “Satisfaction,” earned him international recognition and praise from Carl Cox, Boy George, and Timo Maas followed by "Rock'n' Rave." Since then, he has remixed Madonna, Outkast, Goldfrapp, Shakira, Kid Cudi (just to name a few), and won  a Grammy for Best Remix (Dance) of Public Enemy’s “Bring the Noise.” Benny Benassi is currently ranked the #10 DJ on the DJ List and his new single, "Spaceship" produced by Basic Studio with his cousin Alle Benassi, featuring Kelis, App.de.ap and Jean-Baptiste is due for release on Ultra Records worldwide, soon to be followed by an album. Currently, Benny is touring across the five continents with his <em>Benassi and Friends Tour</em>. Meanwhile, check out what’s hot on his monthly radio mix on Sirius XM Radio's channel Area and be sure to peep the video for Benny Benassi vs. Iggy Pop “Electro Sixteen,” out now on Ultra Records, the mindblowingly kaleidoscopic experimental music video featuring more than 15,000 photographs from his DJ set at New York’s Electric Zoo Festival.</p>
<p>Joining him to send shockwaves across the dancefloor is DJ/producer/connoisseur of cool <strong>Steve Aoki</strong>, spinning at Pacha NYC for his very first time. Founder of Dim Mak Records, Steve Aoki has launched artists including Bloc Party, The Kills, Klaxons, MSTRKRFT, The Bloody Beetroots and The Gossip. He has put his hyper-electro stamp on remixes for everyone from Drake and Duran Duran to The Killers and Weezer, and his most recent remix of Kid Cudi’s “Pursuit of Happiness” is quickly achieving anthem status.  Steve Aoki's 2008 mix album, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles</strong></span> debuted at #15 on the Billboard Electronic Chart; in that same year, he entered the ranks of top DJs who have played for the legendary BBC Radio 1’s Essential Mix. His production group Weird Science (along with Blake Miller) has produced not only Dim Mak originals, but also tracks for Snoop Dogg, Peaches and Rooney. Among other awards, Steve Aoki has won “Best DJ of the Year” from Paper Magazine and the “Best Set of the Season” Ibiza Award in 2007, and has landed on the covers of BPM Magazine, Status Magazine, and L.A. Times’ West Magazine. Not stopping at music, he developed his own collection of tee shirts and hoodies for the Dim Mak Collection, as well as headphones for WESC, sunglasses for KSUBI and bags with Burton. Be sure to give a spin to his newest track, “I’m In the House,” feat. Zuper Blahq, which currently is a top 10 track on the iTunes dance store.</p>
