<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h2>Native Theory Launches with Hisham Samawi</h2>
<p>NEW YORK, NY - After emerging from Winter Music Conference 2003 with <strong>URB Magazine\'s</strong> <strong>Best New Tune - <em>Dirty Gringos \"Cowbell\"</em></strong> - <strong>HISHAM SAMAWI</strong> is set to release two new original tracks (July 2004). Both tracks on the debut release of NYC-based <strong>NATIVE THEORY</strong> record label are already slated for inclusion on <strong>James Zabiela\'s <em>Renaissance: Alive</em></strong> album due out this summer on System Recordings/Renaissance UK.</p>
<p><strong>NATIVE THEORY</strong> the record label first emerged as an idea, then a necessary platform to release tracks that defied conventional definition.  <strong>HISHAM SAMAWI</strong> is leading this charge with two of his original productions on the label\'s debut 12\" \"<strong><em>Holding On / Spirals</em></strong>.\" \"<em>None of our tracks fit neatly into the predefined genres that often stigmatize existing labels.</em>\" Hisham says. \"<em>At the end of the day, we believe in the quality of our music and are proud to release it on our new label.</em>\"  Together with production partner <strong>DENNIS RODGERS (112 Crew)</strong> there are already several tracks set for release later this year.</p>
<p>Born in Libya and raised in Switzerland, <strong>HISHAM SAMAWI</strong> is currently part of the new wave of talented DJs &amp; producers emerging on the global dancescape from New York City. Notable globetrotting DJs <strong>Lee Burridge</strong> and <strong>James Zabiela</strong> both regarded Hisham as one of the <strong>best new artists</strong> to emerge from Winter Music Conference 2004. During the last year, Hisham divided his time in the studio and with gigs around the world. In early 2004, Hisham completed an Asia tour with headlining gigs in Bangkok, Singapore, and Dubai and has also graced the decks at all the major NYC clubs: <strong>Centro-Fly</strong> (RIP), <strong>Discotheque, Filter 14, Sullivan Room</strong> and the closing party at <strong>Arc</strong> with <strong>Lee Burridge</strong> and the <strong>112 Crew</strong>. With an increasingly busy US tour schedule, Hisham has been invited back for return gigs in Charlotte, Los Angeles, Chicago and a new residency at <strong>Privilege</strong> nightclub in Miami.</p>
<p>As a DJ, the music he blends together has been described as \"<em>future music.</em>\" It\'s an amalgam of tracks that are obscure (you won\'t see these charted on anyone\'s Top 10) but mixed together they are the soundtrack for a dancefloor odyssey. On his own sets, Hisham says \"<em>I don\'t really know what to call my sound. I just play records that move me and let others worry about what it is called. In my opinion, a good DJ makes everyone leave the club thinking he played a different sound. A good DJ makes a techno fan think he heard techno that night and a house head think he heard house.</em>\"</p>
<p>With several tracks played and charted by many of the scene\'s most respected DJs, the industry is taking notice of Hisham\'s production talent. In 2003, his remix of the classic track \"<em><strong>Atlas - Compass Error</strong></em>\" on Plastica Red/R.I.P was hailed as \"<em>earth-shattering</em>\" and a \"<em>can\'t miss release</em>\" by <strong>Big Shot Magazine</strong> and <strong>DJ Hyper</strong> labeled it a \"<em>stunning breakbeat mix</em>\" in his review for <strong>iDJ</strong>. Besides his solo productions, Hisham is one third of the production group, <strong>Dirty Gringos</strong> (with <strong>Brendan Benke</strong> and <strong>Dennis Rodgers-112 Crew</strong>), which earned high distinction from <strong>URB Magazine</strong> during WMC 2003 for the Christopher Walken sampled \"<strong><em>Cowbell.</em></strong>\"  His productions have already received huge support from top DJ talent including <strong>Sasha &amp; John Digweed, Danny Tenaglia, Lee Burridge , Danny Howells, Sander Kleinenberg , DJ Three</strong> and <strong>James Zabiela</strong>. Never a moment</p>
