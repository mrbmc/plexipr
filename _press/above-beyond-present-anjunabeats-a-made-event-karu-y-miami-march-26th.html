Above &amp; Beyond present Anjunabeats<br />
a Made Event<br />
@ Karu &amp; Y, Miami</strong></p>
<p><strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong> and the highly respected <strong>Anjunabeats</strong> label have announced their WMC ’09 plans, with a party at <strong>Karu &amp; Y</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday March 26th</strong></span>,  a <strong>Made Event</strong>.  For this exclusive event <em><strong>Anujunabeats </strong></em>will be hosting two rooms at Karu &amp; Y.  Room 1 will feature Anjunabeats label heads <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong> along with Cosmic Gate,<strong> Martin Roth,  Signalrunners, Boom Jinx</strong>, and very special guest <strong>Josh Gabriel</strong>.  Room 2 will be hosted by <em><strong>Anjunadeep</strong></em>, the sub label behind the recent<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> Anjunadeep:01</em></span> album.  The room will feature <strong>Jody Wisternoff</strong> of <strong>Way Out West</strong> along with <em><strong>Anjunadeep</strong></em> rising stars <strong>Electrobios, Liluca</strong>, and <strong>James Grant</strong>.</p>
<p>In a short period of time,<strong> Above &amp; Beyond’s Anjunadeep</strong> imprint has grown from being a promising sibling to the Anjunabeats label, to a dynamic and influential imprint in its own right, pioneering a sound somewhere between house and trance.  About the label’s sound, Above &amp; Beyond’s Tony McGuinness said: "<em>The road between house and trance used to be a dusty, barren path, visited by only the truly brave. But in the last few years it has become an exciting, bustling place with constant traffic going both ways. Anjunadeep is that lovely, shiny building on the left with all the people looking in the window</em>." Winning fans such as James Zabiela, Desyn Masiello, Eric Prydz and Laurent Garnier along the way, Anjunadeep recently received a nomination for "Best Record Label" at DJ Magazine’s Best of British Awards 2008.</p>
<p>The sub label's debut compilation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anjunadeep:01</strong></span> features Anjunadeep stalwarts <strong>Jaytech</strong>, <strong>Michael Cassette</strong> (aka Komytea), <strong>Interplay</strong>, <strong>Joonas Hahmo</strong> and recent high profile addition <strong>16 Bit Lolitas</strong>.  They are joined by newer faces like Colombia's <strong>Liluca</strong>, Russia's <strong>Proff </strong>and Canadian <strong>Paul Keeley</strong>, as Above &amp; Beyond conjure up two CDs of spirited melodic house music. A special treat comes in the form of Above &amp; Beyond’s own remix of<strong> Radiohead</strong>'s "Reckoner”, officially licensed via XL Recordings for the physical format only.</p>
<p>The breathtaking and opulent <strong>Karu &amp; Y</strong> is located in the heart of Miami’s expanding arts and entertainment downtown district. The newly re-opened 42,000 square foot venue, provides the ultimate entertainment playground with a few Zen twists. From the entryway’s signature waterfalls enter into the vast layout, including the Y Ultralounge and Garden, the newly dubbed Champagne Lounge, and Buddha Club with its far east inspired décor. Immerse yourself in this ultra-trendy, sleek nightclub with today's and tomorrow's biggest dance music stars.</p>
