<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> welcomes the Spanish techno conquistador <strong>Paco Osuna</strong> back to New York along with Argentine techno wonderkid and <em>Minus</em> favorite <strong>Barem</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 28th, 2010</strong></span>.<br />
<strong><br />
Paco Osuna</strong>’s hard, driving brand of techno fuses tribal percussive beats alongside the more surgical sounds associated with the acclaimed Minus label. He’s known for three-deck sets of dark synth rhythms and talent for driving any dancefloor crazy with variations in rhythmic tension.  Osuna began his rise to prominence in 1999 with a residency at the famed Ibizan hotspot Amnesia. Then, in 2006 he created Barcelona’s Club4, which brought the likes of Carl Cox, Marco Carola, and Matthew Dear to its DJ booth. That same year, he created his own label <em>Mindshake</em>, which released material from artists like Paul Ritch, Ambivalent and Andrea Ferlin. His skills have also entered him to the Plus8 ranks, including two Plastikman remixes for the label’s 100th release.</p>
<p><strong>Barem</strong> perfectly personifies the new breed of electronic musician.   Growing up entirely in the digital age, he fully utilizes intuitive software programs to spontaneously express ideas and emotions. In 2005, Barem was introduced to <em>Minus</em> boss Richie Hawtin, which eventually led to the debut of his well received EP <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never Better Then Late</span>. Listening to the EP, it’s clear he concentrates most of his energy into creating powerful basslines that define his sound. His expansive use of reverb and delay creates a massive space for the subtle percussive elements to skip and snake while distant, sometimes eerie melodies often occur on a random, secondary level as a result of these interacting elements. For Barem, the bottom line is to keep things simple and stay true to the old school minimalist approach that first got him hooked on the music.</p>
