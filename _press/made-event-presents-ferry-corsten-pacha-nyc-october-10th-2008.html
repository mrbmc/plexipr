FERRY CORSTEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents world renowned DJ/producer <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, October 10th, 2008</span></strong> for an incredible night with one of the leading trance pioneers of the past decade.</p>
<p>Recently, Ferry has been busy finishing up his highly anticipated new artist album 'Twice In A Blue Moon' due out later this year worldwide on Flashover Recordings.  "Radio Crash", the new energetic and funky sounding first single from the album, is already being played by Tiesto, Armin van Buren, and Above &amp; Beyond to an overwhelming response.  In addition the acclaimed DJ's two legendary remixes of U2's "New Year's Day" are finally being released on the re-mastered edition of the U2 album 'War'.  Originally created for the millennium celebration, these remixes have never been commercially released before and have since become a classic NYE anthem played by countless DJs every year.</p>
<p>Ferry's weekly radio show<em> "Corsten's Countdown"</em> is spreading across the globe including XM Radio and major commercial stations in Holland, Europe, Brazil and Mexico. Every week Ferry Corsten introduces new tracks and plays his favourite records of the moment during the one hour show, while at the same time listeners can vote on his website for the countdown at the end of the month. This unique concept is the first radio show worldwide that allows listeners to actively vote on the internet and decide what the hits of the future will be. The radio show is broadcasted every Wednesday night at 2 PM US ET on <a href="http://">www.di.fm</a> and every Thursday at 12 AM US ET on America's largest satellite radio station XM Radio (<a href="http://">www.xmradio.com</a>).
