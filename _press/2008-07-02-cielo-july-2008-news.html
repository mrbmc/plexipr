<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cielo : July 2008 News</strong></p>
<p>The month of Independence welcomes the crème of US talent to grace Cielo's decks - plus a few choice Europeans and there's even a Brit in the house on the 4th of July, so no bias from us! It's no wonder then that the ResidentAdvisor.net Club Awards kicked off with the ten best programmed venues in the world with Cieo ranking in at #5, the only North American club to make the list. July also marks the release of Cielo's new compilation ‘Cinco', mixed by residents Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff and released by Tommy Boy Records on July 8th. Update magazine awarded it 5 Dancin' Men calling it "<em>a sleek, sexy, soul-soothing collection... in a time where we're increasingly being told to find new ways to let off stream from the riggers of city living, this comes as the ideal tonic.</em>" It's another essential package with 2xCDs packed with new music and remixes from the likes of Carl Craig, Arnold Jarvis, Swayzak, Kenny Bobien, K-Scope, Justin Martin, Charles Webster, Nick Holder, DJ Pippi, and Manoo &amp; Francois A, and dozens more.Dance.Here.Now. kick-starts the Independence Day celebrations by welcoming back San Francisco's leading light Behrouz, on July 3rd. After a 20 year career he still finds it hard to categorize his style, but we say if you take the best from deep, tribal and progressive house and add a touch of electro and minimal techno, you'll be close to pigeonholing the man who hates to be pigeonholed!</p>
<p><strong>Lee Burridge</strong> is acknowledged as one of England's leading house DJs, thanks in part to his prolific Tyrant residency at Fabric alongside Craig Richards. Lee spent the majority of the '90s in Hong Kong, where he honed his skills, and as with Behrouz, when listening to a Burridge set, you can always expect the unexpected. Headlining the Made Event on Independence Day you'll hear his unique mix of house and techno that has earned him an adoring fan-base and a consistent rank in DJ magazine's top 100 DJs listing.</p>
<p><strong>Tedd Patterson</strong>'s acclaimed Vibal night is back on Saturday 5th delivering another edifying and soul-satisfying selection of gospel enriched house and polished garage grooves - his signature sound incorporating an intoxicating blend of contemporary and classic dance styles. Little wonder that thousands of fans worldwide have been seduced by Tedd's wickedly innovative sets that combine driving percussive beats and deep techno textures with throbbing progressive house, soaring Afro-Latin grooves reflecting a diverse array of influences.</p>
<p>Monday's at Cielo is <strong>Deep Space</strong> - Francois K's acclaimed residency - a seriously seductive night of tripped out bliss and mind-enveloping music. The legendary New Yorker has been educating audiences longer then most and rightly earned the Wikipedia billing of being widely considered as "<em>one of the forefathers of house music</em>". You've four chances to experience his aural soundscapes for yourself in July - 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th.</p>
<p>The Made Event on Thursday 10th welcomes Germany's <strong>Loco Dice</strong> for the official US launch party for his new album, ‘7 Dunham Place'. Billed as an album to take listeners on a journey, the electronic musician who operates out of Düsseldorf, has created an opus that plays homage to New York blending hip-hop, funk, electronica, folk and soul to create a soundclash of genres and cacophony of deconstructed beats. Come along and celebrate Loco Dice's personal tribute to NYC.</p>
<p>Fresh Fruit and <strong>Frankie Knuckles</strong> return to Cielo on the 13th for another essential night of feel good house music. Inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for his achievements as a DJ, FK has ruled New York and Chicago since the ‘70s and still continues to impact on the dance scene the world over. His latest studio work, remixing Hercules &amp; Love Affair's ‘Blind', has been proclaimed as a future classic, while his DJ sets are as legendary as his productions. The night promises to be one to educate as much as savor.</p>
<p>On the 17th Dance.Here.Now. presents a night with <strong>John Creamer &amp; Stephane K</strong>. Whilst they might be best-known for their productions and remixing the likes of Moby, New Order, Kosheen and iiO, behind the decks they're equally at home. Children of the original Sound Factory, the duo's style updates the sound playing a grittier side of experimental electronica with sparse, dark progressive elements that release the mind and stimulate the senses.</p>
<p><strong>Jojo Flores</strong> has been steadily building a reputation for his consistent productions, cutting edge remixes and self-assured club sets. Hailing from Montreal, the thirty-something producer, was voted NYC's Undaground Archives' Best International DJ four years running (2002-05) and headlines Playtime on Friday 18th. His signature sound resonates sweet soulful melodies with a profound jazzy vibe blending deep house and afro-Latin rhythms.</p>
<p>Paradizo on Saturday 19th finds our own <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> supplying the soundtrack to what is always guaranteed to be a great night. Matar has always strived to push the envelope further than most dance DJs and in so doing he's rightfully earned the recognition as an architect of the cool, stylish and deep. A night not to be missed.</p>
<p><strong>Hector Romero</strong> is affectionately known one of the nicest men in the industry who for many years has quietly gone about his business managing SAW Recordings and raising the Def Mix profile and global brand. As with David Morales, Frankie Knuckles and Satoshi Tomiie, the man also know as Baby Hec, is an integral part of the Def Mix family deserving the equal billing and superstar DJ status he now commands. Dance.Here.Now. showcases his turntable skills on the 24th.</p>
<p><strong>Sébastian Léger</strong> is a master at knowing that in dance music terms less is almost always more - opting for creating minimalist house productions that work extremely well against his need to create sparse disco sampling arrangements and synth-laden hooks. The French producer headlines the Made Event on the 25th and will no doubt further underscore why he has become one of the leading exponents in the Gallic house revolution for the best part of a decade. Viva la France!</p>
<p>The man of many guises,<strong> John ‘Julius' Knight</strong> is Paradizo's guest on the 26th. The acclaimed producer behind the Cleptomaniacs, Eminence and Body Moods, was born and raised in Brooklyn, with his passion for dance music inspired by hearing Tony Humphries on Kiss FM and Timmy Regisford on WBLS. Probably best known for his work with long time collaborator Brian Tappert, John's involvement with the Soulfuric / Jazz-N-Groove camp goes back to the ‘90s, while his musical sets take in everything from past, present and future house trends.</p>
<p>"<em>In New York's highly competitive (and highly expensive) club scene, it's nigh-on impossible to stand out from the pack. But over the past five years, Cielo has done just that. It doesn't hurt that the Funktion One soundsystem sounds great, but the reason that the club does so well is because of the sounds coming out of those speakers. Whether it be Francois K's deliciously varied Deep Space night on Monday, Louie Vega and Kevin Hedge's Roots party on Wednesday, or the strong set of promoters doing regular nights there that bring in the likes of Lee Burridge, Loco Dice, Danny Tenaglia, Theo Parrish, Chateau Flight and more, it's clear that-for a proper club experience-Cielo does it just about better than anyone else in New York</em>."  -<a href="http://RESIDENTADVISOR.NET">RESIDENTADVISOR.NET</a> Club Awards: Music/Programming (#5 Cielo)</p>
