<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
JOHN DIGWEED<br />
w/ Chris Fortier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the much anticipated return of <em>Bedrock</em> founder and DJ legend <strong>John Digweed</strong> along with longtime friend and cohort <strong>Chris Fortier</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October 9, 2009</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of <strong>John Digweed</strong>. Originally hailing from England but having clearly arrived on the global scene, John has long since cemented his name in the pages of dance music history. John is a DJ's DJ. The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings to the apex of the international DJ world, he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both djs and producers globally. He has become the people’s choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture.</p>
<p>2009 has been a fantastic year for music and a great year for John’s seminal imprint, Bedrock Records. With outstanding tracks from Guy Gerber, Christian Smith &amp; John Selway, and Guy J to name a few, the label has gone from strength to strength with each release. As we follow on from last years 10 year celebration, the main focus on this new album, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bedrock Eleven</strong></span> is on the future. With unreleased tracks that have been severely road tested by Digweed himself, from artists such as Mutant Clan, Marco Bailey, Alex Dolby + Santos,  and James Zabiela. There are also a few classics from the label that have been specially remixed and updated for this album like Moonface`s 'Futurized Fears', Bedrock's 'Emerald' and Tijuana 'Groove is in the air'.<br />
<em><br />
‘Bedrock Eleven’ compiled and mixed by John Digweed is out October 13 on Bedrock Records.</em></p>
