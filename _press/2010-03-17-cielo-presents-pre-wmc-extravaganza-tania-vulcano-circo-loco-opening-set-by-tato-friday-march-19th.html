<em>Cielo Presents</em><br />
Pre-WMC Extravaganza<br />
TANIA VULCANO<br />
Opening Set by  TATO<br />
NICOLAS MATAR + WILIE GRAFF</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">New York City’s renowned nightclub <strong>Cielo</strong> presents a pre-WMC extravaganza right here in NYC with the infamous <em>CircoLoco</em>'s <strong>TANIA VULCANO</strong> with an opening set by <strong>TATO</strong> and CIelo resident DJs <strong>NICOLAS MATAR</strong> &amp; <strong>WILLIE GRAFF</strong> this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, March 19th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cielo</strong></em>’s <strong>Willie Graff</strong> and<strong> Nicolas Matar</strong> welcome <strong>Tania Vulcano</strong> and <strong>Tato</strong> to the DJ booth. Tania hails from Uruguay, but has lived in Ibiza for the last 10-years where she’s made the white island her own. With residencies at Space and DC 10’s infamous <em>Circoloco</em> night she’s truly cemented herself on the international stage playing alongside such legends of house as Danny Tenaglia and Fatboy Slim. Vulcano's unique vibe takes its strength from her surname (yes it’s her real name) as she delivers relentless, flowing rhythm in a journey into true deep underground sounds that go from deep funky house to percussive tribal affairs. Her energy is evident in each session winning crowds over with her incessant foundation of quality house music. Tato, the man named Tomas Estaben, is by her side both professionally and personally – the fellow Circoloco resident is also her boyfriend, and the two are partners in the <em>Isgud</em> record label that specializes in deep and hypnotic house of the finest degree. Tato has previously collaborating with Charles Webster and Pig &amp; Dan, and is known for painting soundscapes crafted from dreamy orchestration and near chilled neo-techno melodies</p>
