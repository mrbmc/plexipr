<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PAXAHAU PARTNERS WITH DETROIT’S CREATIVE COMMUNITY FOR VISUAL ART DISPLAYS<em><br />
Artist Preview May 19 from 6:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Inside Russell Industrial Center</em><br />
</strong></h3>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attend <strong><em>Movement Electronic Music Festiva</em></strong>l, May 28-30 and you will see six major art installations made by Detroit creative set-up across Hart Plaza. Paxahau has teamed up with Detroit Creative Corridor Center (DC3) and Community Arts Moving Projects (CAMP Detroit) for this visually stimulating project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Over the last four years we have subtly incorporated a community art component into the design of the festival grounds and each year the reaction from the attendees and performers has been very positive,”</em> said Sam Fotias, the operations director for Movement.  <em>“This year we decided to partner with CAMP Detroit and Detroit Creative Corridor Center to take the visual art displays we have onsite to the next level."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Being that Movement is an international festival that brings people from all across the world to Detroit, the inclusion of this type of art will give them an even greater appreciation for the talented creative community that exists here in our city.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DC3 and CAMP Detroit reached out to their artist networks to seek applicants from Detroit’s creative community to submit a proposal for their installation idea.  More than fifty artists showed interest in the project, and in the end six installations were selected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“We told the applicants to develop an original design using repurposed materials that they could find in their community,”</em> said Vanessa Miller of CAMP Detroit. <em>“We had so many dynamic submissions sent to us that we wished we could’ve chosen them all.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The installations represent a wide range of mediums. Most will be interactive. Some will be technically complex and involve electronics. Each is sure to inspire. The artists who developed the installations include recent art school graduates, community arts leaders, architects, graphic designers, and electronic and mechanical engineers.</p>
<p>The six installations will be:</p>
<p><strong>1.  We Lift Detroit in Dance Sculpture</strong> submitted by Erin Ellis and Jessica Decker<strong><br />
2.  Intelligent Node Park</strong> submitted by Jake Chidester, Richard Chase, Alisyn Malek<strong><br />
3.  Camp Chillout</strong> submitted by Christian Jay Sienkiewicz<strong><br />
4.  Wild Aesthetic</strong> submitted by Sean Hages<strong><br />
5.  Rube Goldberg Machine</strong> submitted by AJ Manoulian<strong><br />
6.  Janus Tunnel</strong> submitted by Dan Roberts and Erin Sweeny</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Artist sketches can be found at <a href="http://t.ymlp14.net/usmjyafahyjakajhuakaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">www.paxahau.com/festival/press/camp</a>.  The progress is also being updated on <a href="http://t.ymlp14.net/usmbsaoahyjazajhuaraqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">http://campdetroit.tumblr.com/</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the six teams has been given $1,000 to help with the development of their installation. Funding to support the artists was provided in part by Detroit Creative Corridor Center and the Detroit Techno Foundation.  The majority of the assembly of the installations will take place in a 50,000 square-foot area at Russell Industrial Center in Detroit.  They will be moved onto the festival ground the week of May 22.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Artist Preview May 19</strong><br />
On May 19 the artists developing the six installations will host a preview event for the public at the Russell Industrial Center, located at 1635 Clay Ave. in Detroit.  From 6:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. people can get a sneak peak at the progress being made with the development of the installations.  It will be a festive preview with music from DJs: Jen Rhode (DorkWave), DJ Amy Dreamcatcher, and Sara Aldridge.</p>
