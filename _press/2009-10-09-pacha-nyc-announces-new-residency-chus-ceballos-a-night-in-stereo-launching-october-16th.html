<em>Pacha NYC and Stereo Productions present</em><br />
A Night in Stereo: The Residency Launch<br />
CHUS + CEBALLOS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Pacha NYC </strong></em>presents <strong>CHUS + CEBALLOS</strong> for the start of their brand new DJ residency “<strong>A Night in Stereo: The Residency Launch</strong>” on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October 16, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Hailing all the way from Spain,<strong> CHUS + CEBALLOS</strong> are the newest dynamic DJ duo to hit Gotham and are poised to bring Pacha NYC into a new era of brilliant beats with their trademark Iberican Sound. This unique sound retains a clear latin influence, a heavy and dense afro-tribal feeling, a great rhythm component, coupled with expert professional technique that inject their sets full of energy and good taste. The charisma and authenticity of their talents, the feeling exuded from the booth and the resulting groove is 100% Pure House, 100% Iberican Sound!</p>
<p>About the upcoming residency at Pacha NYC, Chus + Ceballos share their thoughts on their connection to the New York scene, “<em>We are SOOOO excited about it because Pacha is the place to be in New York. After having a really successful year in the city, this residency comes at the right time to finally make a solid C+C night in the Big Apple. One of the reasons for this is the open character and Latin influence in our music- we love the groove and the beats so does the New York crowd. In the club, we are the first ones to have fun and because of this the people get infected automatically- people love when they see the DJs smiling and enjoying it. This global feeling of celebration that you can find at our parties is really welcomed by the New York crowd, the grade of connection is at maximum and we see that gig after gig the crowd is growing and the expectation is bigger.</em>”</p>
<p>Chus + Ceballos are evangelizing their Iberican sound across the globe with prominent residences at Pacha NYC, Pacha Ibiza, Space Miami, Spy Bar Chicago, the newly reopened Stereo Montreal and a weekly radio show called ‘<em><strong>In Stereo RadioShow</strong></em>' which airs in Spain, Portugal, France, and Greece and worldwide on online platforms<a href="http://"> DI.com</a> and <a href="http://">VOYNC.com</a>. Along with their impressive roster of original tracks and remixes on their own label <em><strong>Stereo Productions </strong></em>and other stronghold imprints, they are driving the musical mothership on the house front captivating dancefloors all over the world.</p>
