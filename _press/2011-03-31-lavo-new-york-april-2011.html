<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Friday, April 1 – HOLY GHOST! Afterparty (DJ Set)  &amp; Drek Martinez</strong><br />
Holy Ghost! just embarked on a grand North American tour with Aussie pals Cut Copy, but they’re returning to their hometown of NYC to grace LAVO with an intimate DJ set after their Terminal 5 show. Holy Ghost!’s debut hit single “Hold On” came out in 2007, but Alex Frankel and Nick Millhiser go way back to their elementary school years; and by high school, their hip hop outfit Automato was signed by Capitol Records. After a brief stint apart, the duo reformed as Holy Ghost! and, after releasing "Hold On,” on DFA Records in 2007, promptly found themselves traveling the world as some of the most in-demand DJs, with remix requests from Moby, MGMT and Cut Copy. Holy Ghost!’s 2010 four-song EP, ‘Static on the Wire,’ featured appearances by Juan Maclean and Caroline Polachek of Chairlift, and showcased the depth of their love for dance music across genres, as well as  their ability blend the old – from ’70s and ‘80s funk-inflected R&amp;B to glittery disco to synthy new wave – and the new. Holy Ghost!’s highly anticipated first full length comes out April 12th, and includes their already ubiquitous first single “Do It Again,” as well as guest appearances from Luke Jenner from the Rapture, Chris Glover from Penguin Prison, and Michael McDonald. They recently released the album’s second single “Wait &amp; See” for free download <a href="http://t.ymlp29.net/ywsjazajbeaoawalaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Thursday, April 14 – CHUCKIE</strong><br />
Chuckie recently revealed his official remix of Michael Jackson’s “Hollywood Tonight” -- a progressive house rework with his signature Dutch influence. Chuckie is the mastermind behind the Dirty Dutch phenomenon, known for its addictive hip-hop influenced house sound and global music events, which have featured guests like David Guetta and NERD. Chuckie’s monster tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” have been supported by the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Laidback Luke and Pete Tong, and he has remixed David Guetta and Bob Sinclar, among others. Chuckie has landed a multi-album artist deal with Atlantic Records in America, and been working with megastars like Jermain Dupri, Diddy, Lil Jon, Estelle, Toni Braxtor and Akon -- and he’s recently been spending time in the studio with T-Pain and Kelly Rowland. His busy touring schedule also includes playing headlining sets at some of the world’s biggest festivals as well as a monthly rotation on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ show. No stranger to the intimate dancefloor at LAVO, Chuckie returns for another session of electrifying house bangers.</p>

Rony Seikaly recently released a new single called “The World Is Beautiful,” an uplifting and emotive house ode to planet Earth, on Erick Morillo’s Subliminal Records label. Formerly known as “The Spin Doctor,” ex-NBA superstar Rony Seikaly is now known as a DJ/producer with a raw talent for spinning a unique style of body-shaking house music with touches of trance-inflected melody lines, dynamic tribal rhythms and a soulful vibe.

His debut artist album, Subliminal Essentials Presents: House Calls by Rony Seikaly, is a global dance album includes underground-influenced tracks like “Ignition” and “Session 13” as well as high energy bangers like “Carry The Light.” A regular in LAVO’s cast of superstar DJs, he’s back to deliver a signature sexy, melodic, deep and energetic set.</p>
