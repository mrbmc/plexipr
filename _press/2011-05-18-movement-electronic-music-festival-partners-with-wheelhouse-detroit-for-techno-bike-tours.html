<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Movement Electronic Music Festival</strong> attendees will be able to take a break from the beats pulsating throughout Hart Plaza May 28-30 to explore the landmarks of Detroit Techno with bike tours provided by <strong>Wheelhouse Detroit</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wheelhouse Detroit, located on E. Atwater Street along the Detroit River, will guide the two Techno-themed bike tours they have dubbed “Techno in the 313.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“This tour will bring the beats that electrify Detroit to life,”</em> states Kelli Kavanaugh, co-owner of Wheelhouse Detroit, <em>“Many tourists find bikes to be the most convenient way to get around Detroit and Movement weekend in particular lends itself well to bike transportation.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first tour will be on Sunday, May 29 from noon to 4 p.m.  It will be the “long” tour that will go for as many as 21 miles taking riders past historic electronic music sites like The Music Institute, Underground Resistance HQ, and the Packard Plant.  The tour price is $30; with bike rental it's $40. This “long” tour is recommended for more experienced riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second will be Monday, May 30 from noon until 3 p.m. It will be the “short” tour. A rider will see landmarks such as The Music Institute, Underground Resistance HQ, and the East Riverfront Warehouse District.  The tour price is $25; with bike rental it’s $35.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bike tours are capped at 15 people to ensure safety and a personal experience. Each tour will have a trained tour guide and a mechanical sweeper along with a lock and helmet.  To book a tour or learn more visit <a href="http://t.ymlp85.net/usjumafawumatabealaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">www.wheelhousedetroit.com</a> <strong> </strong></p>
