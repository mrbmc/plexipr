<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Friday, September 2<br />
ROGER SANCHEZ + EC TWINS @ Dayclub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"Marquee has been a fantastic residency for me in Las Vegas -- the multimedia installation is unbelievable and the crowds are totally up for a great night! The pool party during the day was one of my highlights this year and the Marquee club events just keep getting better!"</em> Roger Sanchez says of his monthly ‘Release Yourself’ party at Marquee. He recently put out ‘Release Yourself ‘11,’ featuring 29 exclusive house tracks covering the spectrum of dance music - preview it on his <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumheadausejaoaujjadaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> - and nab a free Roger Sanchez remix download <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhmagausejaiaujjaaaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Known for their incredibly infectious high energy shows, The EC Twins continue their quest to rule the electronic music world. Their original track with Remy Le Duc, "Say Yes," hit the top 40 on the Beatport Progressive House Charts while their remix with Remy Le Duc of David Garcia &amp; High Spies’ "All Here Now" has broken the top 10 on Billboard's Dance charts and is still climbing. Instrumental in paving the way for house music domination on a global scale, The EC Twins return to Marquee regularly to share their trendsetting sounds.<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Friday, September 2<br />
ARMIN VAN BUUREN + BLAKE JARRELL @ Nightclub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Armin van Buuren has been named number one in the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 poll four times in a row -- an indication of his prolific output over the more than 14 years he’s been DJing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements: his award-winning ‘A State of Trance’ radio show boasting over 15 million listeners per week, four chart-topping artist albums, music video for “In &amp; Out of Love,” one of the top 40 most-viewed music videos of all time on YouTube and his highly-regarded Armada music label which releases tracks by some of the biggest names in trance, progressive and house much, much more. The driving force behind all his success is an undeniable, overriding passion for dance music. After the smash success of his Memorial Day White Party, Armin returns to Marquee this Labor Day Weekend.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the fastest rising stars in dance music today, Armada artist Blake Jarrell returns to Marquee with fresh tunes to keep the dancefloor moving. He also continues to host his monthly “Concentrate Podcast,” featuring signature mix sets and special international guests.  Blake also recently released an original track called “Maldives,” a huge summer anthem currently climbing the Beatport Top 10 Trance Chart with support from Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery, Above &amp; Beyond and more. Listen to the track <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhjaoausejataujjaaaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">here</a>.<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saturday, September 3<br />
MARKUS SCHULZ + EDX @ Dayclub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>“It seems to be Marquee above all other places where this track gets such a massive reaction,” said Markus Schulz on playing Hard Rock Sofa &amp; St, Brother’s “Blow Up” (Thomas Gold &amp; Axwell remix) in May. “I had such a fun time, especially with the guys from Far East Movement hanging out and rocking out along with the crowd.” Anyone who’s attended a date of Markus’ residency knows that this Top 10 DJ never disappoints, fusing progressive, house and trance into his own creative, inimitable hybrid sound. Markus recently released the critically acclaimed ‘Thoughts Become Things II’ album under his alter-ego Dakota. Preview the distinct club sound <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhbakausejaxaujjagaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Named a “genius” by MixMag, EDX returns to Marquee to set the poolside party off with his Beatport chart-topping tracks. With huge remixes for the likes of Deadmau5, Axwell, Steve Angello, Roger Sanchez, Laidback Luke, Armin van Buuren and Kaskade (to name but a few), EDX’s acclaim just keeps growing. 2011 sees the release of a highly anticipated album and the launch of his brand, No Xcuses, which has taken over the world's FM airwaves with the No Xcuses radio show. Listen on his <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhhazausejakaujjakaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saturday, September 3<br />
AVICII + COSMIC GATE @ Nightclub<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having already destroyed the dancefloor at Marquee on multiple occasions, Avicii returns to do it all over again. The young talent smashed the past year with worldwide hit singles like “Bromance” and “My Feelings For You” plus hit remixes of Tiësto, Robyn, David Guetta, and Bob Sinclar.  It’s no surprise that his first release of 2011, “Street Dancer,” went straight for number one on the worldwide Beatport charts, followed by acclaimed remixes for Armin van Buuren (“Drowning”) and Daft Punk “Derezzed.” Listen to a preview of “<a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhwaiausejaoaujjakaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Fade</a> <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhwaiausejaoaujjakaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Into</a> <a href="http://t.ymlp108.com/uumhwaiausejaoaujjakaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Darkness</a>.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heralded as one of the most creative and sought-after electronic music acts on the planet, Cosmic Gate is responsible for four hugely-received albums containing classic tracks like “Exploration of Space” and “Fire Wire.” Nic and Bossi have also lent their studio know-how to productions for trance music’s A-list, from Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Ferry Corsten and Paul van Dyk to Above &amp; Beyond, Deadmau5 and Rank 1. As DJs, the effortless cool of their kinetic, enthralling live sets take over Marquee on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sunday, September 4<br />
FATBOY SLIM + CHUCKIE + THOMAS GANDEY @ Dayclub<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last month saw Fatboy Slim’s whirlwind of tracks plus infectious energy spilling over to the Fourth of July Weekend warriors splashing in the sun. With classics like “Praise You” and “The Rockafeller Skank” (along with a 3-story high balloon and a custom plexi-glass DJ booth built over the pool) working the crowd into a frenzy, FBS brought the vibe at Marquee Dayclub to new heights. Expect Fatboy Slim to blow the top off once again for the final date of his summer residency at Marquee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most popular DJs in the world, Chuckie’s signature “house-meets-hip-hop” Dirty Dutch sound quickly grew into global music events, as well as wildly successful tracks like “Let The Bass Kick,” a remix of “Sexy Bitch” by David Guetta, and recently a remix of “Stronger” by Erick Morillo and Eddie Thoneick. With a monthly rotation on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ show, Chuckie is set to drop ‘Dirty Dutch Volume 5’ soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas Gandey stormed through 2010 with highly successful EPs for Southern Fried Records, containing the smash track “Mercy Hump” which became a Radio 1 Essential New Tune. Having released two albums, he is also responsible for compilations with Fatboy Slim and remixes for Carl Craig, Editors, The Temper Trap, Grace Jones and more. Thomas brings his captivating DJ style, an alluring mix of tech-house, deep techno and disco mixed with all out party music, back to Marquee’s dancefloor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sunday, September 4<br />
DIRTY SOUTH + GARETH EMERY @ Nightclub<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With his anthemic track “Phazing” still a huge hit worldwide, Dirty South returns to Marquee for his packed monthly <em>Starphazing</em> residency. Fresh off a 2010 Grammy nomination for his co-remix (with Axwell) of The Temper Trap’s “Sweet Disposition,” Dirty South stormed into 2011 with a fresh rinse of Diddy Dirty Money featuring Skylar Grey’s Billboard smash single “Coming Home,” a favorite of Swedish House Mafia. He recently unveiled the ‘Strictly Dirty South’ compilation with legendary label Strictly Rhythm, as well as a new track “Alive” with Thomas Gold, featuring the gorgeous voice of UK singer Kate Elsworth, silky acoustic guitar bits, and contrasting massive breakdowns that rip up the dancefloor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gareth Emery is one of dance music’s most influential and innovative DJ producers, voted no. 7 in DJ Mag’s ‘Top 100 DJs’ poll making him the UK’s highest ranked DJ, and one of the youngest DJs ever to crack the top ten. In 2010, he released his debut artist album ‘Northern Lights’ on his own label Garuda to stunning reactions from fans and critics alike, hitting no.1 on the US iTunes dance chart within hours of release. He also celebrated 100 episodes and four years of his award winning podcast, ‘The Gareth Emery Podcast.’ He returns to Marquee after a stunning set last month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monday, September 5<br />
BENNY BENASSI + GARETH EMERY + PORTER ROBINSON @ Dayclub<br />
(COMPLIMENTARY ADMISSION)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grammy-Award-winning artist, remixer, and producer Benny Benassi recently released his third full-length solo album, ‘Electroman,’ which embraces a myriad of styles including electro, house, pop, R&amp;B and hip-hop (with help from guests including T-Pain, Pitbull, Chris Brown, Kelis, Gary Go, apl.de.ap of The Black Eyed Peas, Ying Yang Twins and more). Benny became a worldwide phenomenon with his 2002 single "Satisfaction," and 2007 remix of Public Enemy classic "Bring the Noise," which won him a Grammy for Best Remixed Recording (Dance). Benny returns to Marquee to deliver yet another floor-shaking set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gareth Emery returns on Monday night for an encore performance at Marquee Nightclub. As one of dance music’s most influential and innovative DJ producers, voted no. 7 in DJ Mag’s ‘Top 100 DJs’ poll making him the UK’s highest ranked DJ, and one of the youngest DJs ever to crack the top ten. In 2010, he released his debut artist album ‘Northern Lights’ on his own label Garuda to stunning reactions from fans and critics alike, hitting no.1 on the US iTunes dance chart within hours of release. He also celebrated 100 episodes and four years of his award winning podcast, ‘The Gareth Emery Podcast.’ He returns to Marquee after a stunning set last month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Newly emerging star Porter Robinson has released a variety of original singles on Glamara Records/Massive 808s and Big Fish Recordings. His first single, "Say My Name", was an enormous success, landing at #1 on Beatport's Electro-House chart. Porter has worked on remixes for Avicii, Spencer &amp; Hill, Innerpartysystem and as a DJ, he has toured internationally and performed alongside acts including Deadmau5, Tiesto, David Guetta, LMFAO, Moby, Afrojack, Dada Life, Gareth Emery, Bart B More, Felguk.

CHUCKIE + MARTIN SOLVEIG @ Nightclub</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>The King of Dirty Dutch and Marquee resident, Chuckie brings Amsterdam’s daring, sophisticated and sexy style back to Marquee Dayclub for a special Labor Day weekend closing party with complimentary admission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">French house producer Martin Solveig has been synonymous with forward-thinking electronic music for over a decade. The masterful, Strokes-inspired tracks on Martin’s 2008 album ‘C’est la Vie’ took the airwaves by storm and resulted in the ‘C’est la Vie Remixes’ album featuring Laidback Luke, The Bloody Beetroots and Fedde Le Grand. Martin’s current track “Hello (feat. Dragonette)” is a breakthrough summertime smash and recently went RIAA Gold. “Hello” also introduced Martin’s recently released fifth studio album, ‘Smash.’ Needless to say, Martin is sure to smash the sound system at Marquee this month.</p>
