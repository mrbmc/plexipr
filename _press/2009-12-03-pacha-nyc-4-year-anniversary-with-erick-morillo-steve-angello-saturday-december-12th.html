<em>Pacha NYC proudly presents </em><br />
THE PACHA NYC 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY<br />
ERICK MORILLO<br />
with special guest<br />
STEVE ANGELLO</strong></p>
<p>Happy birthday to US! <em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> proudly presents our 4 Year Anniversary party on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, December 12th, 2009</strong></span>. This year we'll be celebrating the momentous occasion with our original 2005 opening weekend lineup, resident <strong>DJ ERICK MORILLO</strong> along with very special guest, Mr. Swedish House Mafia himself, <strong>STEVE ANGELLO</strong>. Let’s hear it for 4 more years! 4 more years!</p>
<p>On this auspicious occasion, Pacha NYC president Eddie Dean says, "<em>Music comes first and I think that as long as people keep following their ears, they will keep coming back to Pacha. We have exciting new DJs lined up for 2010 and we will keep bringing in the best for dance music lovers everywhere. A big thank you to all the DJs, promoters, agents, clubbers and staff that will see us through to the next decade of music excellence.</em>"</p>
<p>Over the last 4 years, Pacha NYC has received many accolades including: International Dance Music Awards – Best U.S. Club and Club World Awards – Best Superclub 2009, 2008 &amp; 2007, but the biggest commendation is the thousands of clubbers each weekend who congregate on the dancefloor in search of the perfect beat. In the last year, the launch of <a href="http://www.pachanyc.com/podcast/">Pacha NYC Podcasts</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/pachanewyork">Pacha NYC TV</a> kept us connected with our DJs and our fans and we were pleased to announce new DJ residencies for <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong>, <strong>Chus &amp; Ceballos</strong>, and <strong>Benny Benassi</strong>, all joining our well-respected roster of residents <strong>Erick Morillo</strong>, <strong>Victor Calderone</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Peters</strong> and <strong>Boris</strong>. Now more than ever, Pacha NYC is poised to enter the next decade with the world’s most sought-after DJs and continued decadence in nightlife for the dance music loving masses.</p>
<p>Pacha will also be holding their annual <em><strong>Toys For Tots</strong></em> drive. Guests who donate an unwrapped toy will receive <em><strong>FREE ADMISSION BEFORE 12 MIDNIGHT!</strong></em> The U.S. Marine Corps Reserve <em>Toys for Tots</em> Program collects new, unwrapped toys during the holiday season each year, and distributes those toys as Christmas gifts to needy children in the community. Any and all toy donations are appreciated.</p>
