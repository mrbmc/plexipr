<p><strong>Thursday, January 19<sup>th</sup> - Redfoo &amp; The Party Rock Crew of LMFAO</strong><br />
Redfoo has established himself as an international tour de force of showmanship and musical performance. As one-half of EDM mega duo LMFAO, Redfoo, along with SkyBlu, has now reached music super-stardom as he grabbed his second consecutive #1 spot in Billboard's highly coveted "Hot 100" chart. Together, LMFAO's two singles, 'Sexy and I Know It' and 'Party Rock Anthem' have garnered an unprecedented 540 million+ views on YouTube. Redfoo is globally recognized for his high-energy live sets with his stable of performers and dancers, affectionately known as "The Party Rock Crew of LMFAO." Their dance-oriented, dutch-beep-infused music set the perfect tone as they effortlessly keep crowds dancing and raging into the night. Redfoo recently signed on with Marquee Las Vegas for his DJ residency in 2012, and will be performing yet again at LAVO New York on Thursday, January 19th. You can expect a wild night of wall-shaking partying and unapologetic party-rocking.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, January 20<sup>th</sup> - Rony Seikaly</strong><br />
Renaissance man Rony Seikaly has a resume that would make even James Bond question his achievements. Upon retiring from the NBA, he founded a successful multi-million dollar real estate investment company, became a partner in 5 award-winning restaurants in South Beach, Miami, all while becoming a globe-trotting international DJ. Seikaly has been traveling the globe, performing at major venues in Las Vegas, New York, Paris, and Ibiza. He has worked with some of the most recognized artists in the industry today, including Cedric Gervais and Eric Morillo, who released Seikaly's first single on the renowned label Subliminal Records. Fresh out right now is his new track "Feel So Good," available for free download from his SoundCloud page, and his Decompression Mix, available from his Facebook Page. When Rony Seikaly returns to LAVO New York on Friday, January 20th, it is guaranteed to be filled to capacity with celebrities, socialites, and international taste-makers.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Saturday, January 21<sup>st</sup> – Avicii’s House for Hunger U.S. Tour</strong><br />
This special night at LAVO New York is the only New York City stop on Avicii’s House for Hunger U.S. Tour, a 26-stop journey across the country to raise money for Feeding America. Grammy nominated Swedish DJ Avicii and his manager and executive producer Arash "Ash" Pournouri have announced a commitment to donate $1 million dollars in gig fees received from the tour to Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization comprised of more than 200 member food banks across the country. The donation will help provide approximately 8 million meals to those in need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Avicii, born Tim Bergling in Stockholm, has had a meteoric rise to the very top of the electronic dance music industry. The 22 year-old Swedish-born producer and DJ creates music that transcends genres and cultural barriers. His historic 2011 included claiming the #6 spot on DJ Mag's Top 100 list, performing sold out shows worldwide, including selling out his massive New Year's Eve show at NYC's Pier 94, a Grammy nomination for "Sunshine" - his collaboration with David Guetta - and creating the now legendary single "Le7els", which broke into Billboard's Hot 100, hit No. 1 on their Club Play Chart, climbed to No. 1 on the international Beatport chart and was proclaimed “Tune of 2011” by Guetta himself.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, January 26<sup>th</sup> – Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike</strong><br />
Belgian brothers Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike have come a very long way in a very short period of time. In just 2 years, they’ve bypassed the usual steps to making it big by proving they have super-star quality in everything they do. They are sought after producers, smashed straight into the celebrated halls of the DJ Mag Top 100 at 79 after only two years performing, have remixed the likes of Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, LMFAO, the Swedish House Mafia and more and have become the poster boys for the new generation of stadium heroes. With their own unique brand of dance floor-busting hedonism and an innate ability to rock any crowd put before them, Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike continue to make massive waves as 2012 unfolds.</p>
