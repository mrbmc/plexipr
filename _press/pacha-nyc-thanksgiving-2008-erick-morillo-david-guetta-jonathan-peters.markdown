<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Erick Morillo</strong> returns yet again to his home in New York City to kick off a Thanksgiving weekend full of top-tier DJs.  This summer saw the release of Subliminal Sessions 12, a double disc compilation mixed by none other than Morillo himself, which received highly acclaimed review.  Recently, Pete Tong listed Morillo and DJ DLG's "Where Are You Now" as his Essential New Tune.  It seems as if everything Erick Morillo puts his hands on is automatically set for success. Get ready to move it, move it!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There are few DJs in the world that create the reaction that <strong>David Guetta</strong> sparks. Whether it's 50,000 fans singing along to his hit records at the recent massive Stade De France stadium Unighted über-party, or dark rooms of clubbers locked in the groove nine hours into his set, Guetta gets passions flowing. That's because he uniquely and boldly treads a tightrope most DJs wouldn't dare to traverse: the line between being an underground DJ and having huge crossover success.</p>

Classic B Sides<br />
$20 Advance Tickets while supplies last at <a href="http://">www.pachanyc.com</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though when he began he was mostly unknown outside of New York, <strong>Jonathan Peters</strong> became one of the city's most popular DJs in the late '90s and early 2000s thanks to his long-running Saturday night residency at Sound Factory. In addition to his DJing credentials, Peters also produces his own tracks and also remixes the work of others including Janet Jackson, Aretha Franklin, DMX, and the Spice Girls, among many, many others.  Jonathan Peters is now an internationally recognized DJ and will be spinning some of his more obscure B-side classics at Pacha to close out this special Thanksgiving weekend celebration.</p>
