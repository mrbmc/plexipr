<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
John O’Callaghan<br />
<em>@ Cielo</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents Irish trance superstar<strong> John O’Callaghan</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, July 9, 2009</strong></span></p>
<p>It has taken <strong>John O’Callaghan</strong> just 5 short years to outrun his ‘next big thing’ tag and move over to the A-list fast-track. DJ sets at some of the world’s premier events and consistent quality studio work define John as a masterful dance artist with a unique ear for trance and a pin-point style of mixing. Last year this gifted Irishman recorded his first <em>Radio 1 Essential Mix</em> and entered the prestigious <em>DJ Mag Top 100</em> list at No. 60. He also picked up ‘Best Producer’ and ‘Best DJ’ trophies at the Irish Dance Music Awards, as well as decisively conquering the competitive dance-testing ground of Ibiza with dates at Judgement Sundays and Armada @ Amnesia.</p>
<p>Since making his first moves into the studio in 2003, John has provided dance floors with a slew of releases on respected labels such as <em>Armada</em>, <em>Vandit</em>, and <em>Doorn Records</em>. Club killers like ‘The Chamber’, ‘Exactly’ &amp; ‘Space &amp; Time’ have all become mainstays of trance sets the world over. In 2007, John released the track ‘Big Sky’. Upon release, it rapidly gained modern trance classic status, virtually taking on a life of its own. That year, it was voted No. 1 trance tune on A State of Trance.  Although his studio career carries more of an original production bias, John has provided his own interpretations of tracks by Armin van Buuren, Agnelli &amp; Nelson, Dogzilla, Ronski Speed and Filo &amp; Peri amongst others.  Often reaching cult status amongst underground trance enthusiasts John’s studio work has made him one of the most in-demand producers &amp; remixers in electronic dance music today.</p>
<p>In 2009 John O’Callaghan stands at the threshold of dance superstardom. His second album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Never Fade Away</span> and its single ‘Find Yourself’ have been garnering positive reviews throughout the world of dance music. The album is being hailed as one of the best trance albums in years. The single has already been described as bigger then ‘Big Sky’ by the likes of Armin van Buuren, Judge Jules, and Gareth Emery. ‘Find Yourself’ has poised itself to be a feature in DJ sets throughout the world for some time.  Along with multiple summer dates at Cream Ibiza and a successful monthly radio show on DI.fm entitled ‘Subculture’, John has quickly found himself as one of the primary ambassadors of the new trance sound.</p>
