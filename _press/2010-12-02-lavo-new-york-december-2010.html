<p><strong>LAVO New York</strong> storms into December and the holidays after a much-heated November. Always the epitome of New York sophistication and class, LAVO patrons danced the nights away to the intoxicating sounds of Calvin Harris, Tatiana Fontes and Behrouz. December continues to see the best DJs in clubbing close out the year with a bang. Check out the decadent stylings at New York's newest midtown clubbing mecca in this video.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, December 2 – MITCH LJ &amp; CHRIS LAKE</strong><br />
Mitch LJ and Chris Lake team up for a sensational night at Lavo. An accomplished jazz drummer before becoming a DJ in 2000, Mitch LJ quickly became one of Europe’s most sought-after DJs. Hailing from the South of France, he earned a stint as Nikki Beach St. Tropez’s Official DJ, representing the brand worldwide. Since then, he has taken his sexy and uplifting house music sets to San Paolo, Moscow, Frankfurt, Madonna’s afterparty in London, Pamela Anderson’s wedding and now New York City, where he currently lives. Celebrated house music producer Chris Lake is known for his electro-pop crossover productions, especially the chart-topping “If You Knew.” He continues his ascent with two Billboard #1 hits and multiple albums, including the brand new “Cross The Line” out now on Nervous Records. His label, Rising Music, is in its fifth year and continues to support the best young talent from around the world. Expect Lake to spin on the darker and deeper side of electronic music, fused with homemade edits, for a unique experience to be remembered.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, December 9 – TATIANA FONTES</strong><br />
Brazilian born Tatiana Fontes returns with her crowd-pleasing  fusion of the 80s and rock from her youth, along with European house and electronic music. She already boasts a diverse selection of careers: international supermodel, Hollywood actress, and now back to her true passion as a DJ. With a father who was a nightclub owner and brothers who were professional DJs, Tatiana grew up in the DJ booth and her affinity for music was a homegrown affair.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, December 11 – RONY SEIKALY</strong><br />
Formerly known as “The Spin Doctor,” ex-NBA superstar Rony Seikly is now known as an up-and-coming DJ/Producer with a raw talent for spinning a unique style of body-shaking house music with touches of trance-inflected melody lines, dynamic tribal rhythms and a soulful vibe.  A longtime partner in clubs around the Miami area, Seikly now spins at hot spots around the world like LIV (Miami), Pacha (NYC) and Amnesia (Ibiza). He recently signed with Erick Morillo’s Subliminal Records and released his debut artist album, Subliminal Essentials Presents: House Calls by Rony Seikaly, in October. This global dance album includes underground-influenced tracks like “Ignition” and “Session 13” as well as high energy bangers like “Carry The Light.”</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, December 16 – JACK E</strong><br />
Saint Tropez jet set DJ Jack E touches down for a sizzling night of musical abandon. In the internationally-known seaside resort, known as the playground to jetsetters, fashion models, and millionaires, Jack E brings the glamour as resident DJ at Les Caves du Roy in the Hotel Byblos. This is where he popularized his iconic catchphrase <em>"Welcome back to St. Tropeeeeezzzzz!"</em> and now just as the weather starts to turn,  Jack E brings a little bit of St. Tropez summer heat to Lavo's dancefloor.</p>
