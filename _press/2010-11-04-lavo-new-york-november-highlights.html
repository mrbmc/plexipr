CALVIN HARRIS</strong><br />
Scottish DJ, producer and in-demand remixer Calvin Harris plays a special mid-week gig amidst his extensive North American tour. The self-styled "King of Electropop" has created hit records for Kylie Minogue, collaborated with Dizzee Rascal, and remixed the likes of Cut Copy, The Ting Tings, Groove Armada, Katy Perry and Kelis. His debut album ‘I Created Disco’ (2007) reached gold status and established him as one of the prime movers on the UK dance scene. His latest album ‘Ready For The Weekend’ (2009) introduced his stadium-sized sound with massive riffs, big hands-in-the-air moments, and almost overnight the album reached #1 in the UK. Now this Brit Award nominee for Best Solo Male brings his massive electropop sound to LAVO’s intimate dancefloor.</p>

TATIANA FONTES</strong><br />
Brazilian born Tatiana Fontes boasts a diverse selection of careers: international supermodel, Hollywood actress, and now back to her true passion as a DJ. With a father who was a nightclub owner and brothers who were professional DJs, Tatiana grew up in the DJ booth and her affinity for music was a homegrown affair. Her style is a fusion of the 80s and rock from her youth, along with European house and electronic music.</p>
