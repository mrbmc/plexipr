<p style="text-align: justify;">Internationally acclaimed nightclub operator Tao Group is set to bring a monumental change to Sydney’s nightlife landscape with the opening of <strong>Marquee - The Star, Sydney</strong> in late March 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new nightclub – the latest jewel in The Star’s $870 million redevelopment - will be overseen by experienced operators Noah Tepperberg, Rich Wolf, Louis Abin, Marc Packer and Jason Strauss, alongside a strong Sydney based team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tao Group has been the force behind the world renowned TAO in New York and Las Vegas, LAVO New York and Las Vegas and Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. The joint venture with The Star’s parent company, Echo Entertainment, will be the group’s first venture outside the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marquee - The Star, Sydney</strong> will be located on the entire top tier of The Star’s new Pirrama Road harbourside entrance, commanding expansive views of Sydney Harbour and the city skyline. With nearly 20,000 square feet of floor space, the venue is designed to house three distinct spaces within the one venue to cater for different tastes and moods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The recently opened Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas boasts an impressive roster of resident DJs, including Erick Morillo, Kaskade, Red Foo from LMFAO, DJ Chuckie and DJ Vice.  Guests at the club’s grand opening party included A-list celebrities Jay Z, Beyonce, Chris Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz, Rihanna, Kanye West, Mark Wahlberg and Blake Lively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Noah Tepperberg, from Tao Group said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Our team is looking forward to bringing the Marquee brand to Sydney while creating a venue with a distinct Sydney style and personality.  Its been great to see The Star unfold into an impressive casino and hotel, and now dining and entertainment complex, and we are excited to work with the talented Australian based team.“  </em></p>

Located on the entire top floor of The Star’s glass façade harbourside entrance, <strong>Marquee – The Star, </strong><strong>Sydney</strong> will have a capacity of more than 1,200 people.  Patrons will be able to transition between three lavish rooms and various music experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Main Room</em> will feature a 30 foot projection stage with an LED DJ booth and two dance floors.  In contrast, a stylish library-style room will offer an intimate lounge experience, accentuated by a working fireplace.  Venturing further into the venue, club-goers will come across the <em>Boom Box</em>, with a separate DJ, state-of-the-art sound system and outdoor patio.  There is also a chill-out area with unparalleled views of the Sydney skyline and a unisex “bathroom lounge”.</p>
