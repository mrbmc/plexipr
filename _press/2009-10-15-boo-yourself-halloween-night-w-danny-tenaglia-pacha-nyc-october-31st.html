<em>Pacha NYC presents </em><br />
Boo Yourself!<br />
Halloween Night<br />
DANNY TENAGLIA</strong></p>
<p>Get ready to be spooked as <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong> hands out his sonic Trick-o-Treats for the annual <em><strong>Boo Yourself! </strong></em>Halloween night extravaganza on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, October 31st, 2009</strong></span> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong>.</p>
<p>“<em>October is BOO YOURSELF month!</em>" <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong> exclaims! <em>Boo Yourself!</em> puts a thrilling twist on Danny’s legendary weekly “Be Yourself” parties at the now defunct Vinyl nightclub in New York City, where partygoers, as well as Tenaglia himself, let go of drama and just embraced a night that was all about the music. This was where Tenaglia first was able to truly spread his DJ wings, as these nights allowed him to experiment and play whatever he felt like, and the crowd loved him for it. Through this he gathered international recognition and awards, and subsequently earned the well-known nickname “the DJ’s DJ.” This year, Danny returns to Pacha NYC to hold yet another legendary Halloween bash, and for Vinyl veterans and new Tenaglia fans alike, it will be a spooktacular night to remember.</p>
<p>Don’t be late for this special night of brilliant beats and ghoulish excitement. Cook up a wretched Halloween costume and get lost inside the cavernous halls of Pacha NYC. No one does Halloween like Danny: with his thrilling remixes, bewitching samples, and haunting vocals, he is sure to get you out on the floor, dancing up a storm. With almost inhuman mixing capabilities and booth-to-floor telepathy, Tengalia can twist and turn you out with some of the grittiest "modern yet classic" grooves to ever come out of a speaker. Known for his incredible ability as both a producer and a DJ, Tenaglia will deliver just the right kick to set you rocketing into All Hallow's bliss.</p>
