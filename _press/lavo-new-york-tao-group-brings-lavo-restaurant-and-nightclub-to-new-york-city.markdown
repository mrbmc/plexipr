<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/plexipr_LAVOlogo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2318" title="plexipr_LAVOlogo" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/plexipr_LAVOlogo.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="83" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tao Group </strong>brings their famed Las Vegas nightlife and dining concept to New York City with the launch of <strong>LAVO New York</strong>. Inspired by the original LAVO Las Vegas, the New York location will feature a Southern Italian bistro and state-of-the-art nightclub infused with uptown sensibility.</p>
<p>Helmed by hospitality impresarios Marc Packer, Rich Wolf, Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, the team behind LAVO Las Vegas, TAO Las Vegas/New York/Beach, Avenue, Marquee NY, Stanton Social, Rue 57 and Avra, LAVO New York combines the best elements from their string of highly successful venues.  Designed by ICrave, each element of the space – from the hand-carved wood doors to the vintage light fixtures – will converge to create the ultimate experience in vibe dining and nightlife.</p>
<p>The ultimate subterranean playground which will be run by managing partner Jayma Cardoso and Paul Goldstein, LAVO Nightclub is designed with a multi-layered, voyeuristic approach, ideal for both after dinner entertaining and late night revelry.</p>
<p>On this new venture, LAVO partner Jason Strauss says, <em>“We're excited to present LAVO New York with an electronic dance music format with a line-up of world-class DJs. The dance music scene has really exploded in the last few years and we wanted to provide an upscale clubbing experience with superior sound and lighting for our clientele."</em></p>
<p>Tassel adorned curtains at the entrance open to reveal an expansive herringbone tiled space outfitted with custom designed metal railings, wood tufted panels and rich leathers.  The raised VIP area features plush banquettes, sofas and armchairs.</p>
<p>According to Tepperberg, <em>“Every great club has a disco ball.” </em> In accordance with their impeccable attention to detail, LAVO’s own 3D LED disco ball chandelier was custom designed by ICrave to provide optimal light refraction.</p>
<p>This glittering disco ball illuminates the sunken dance floor, the focal point of the room.  A raised DJ booth that can also be used for performances is visible from any area in the club. An exclusively designed Martin Audio showcase system has been installed to provide unparallel sound resonating throughout the entire space.</p>
<p><strong>LAVO New York</strong> is located at 39 E. 58th Street (between Park and Madison), NY, NY 10022.  LAVO restaurant will be open 7 days a week, from 11:30AM – 1AM.  LAVO Nightclub will be open from Thursday - Saturday, from 10PM – 4AM.  For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.lavony.com">www.lavony.com</a>.</p>

His "Dirty Dutch" style of house music has enthralled a huge number of fans and fellow DJs, even elite trendsetters like David Guetta and Judge Jules.
