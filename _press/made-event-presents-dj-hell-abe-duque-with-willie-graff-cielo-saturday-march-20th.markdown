DJ HELL<br />
&amp; ABE DUQUE<br />
with WILLIE GRAFF<br />
@ Cielo</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents German techno icon and head honcho of the <em>International Deejay Gigolos</em> empire <strong>DJ Hell</strong>, along with <strong>Abe Duque</strong> and <em>Playtime</em> resident <strong>Willie Graff</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 20, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Helmut Geier, aka <strong>DJ Hell</strong>, is one of the most intriguing and respected artists in dance music.  Throughout his illustrious career DJ Hell has establishing himself in the upper echelons of the worlds dance music titans. With a bold musical reputation as a creative rebel and suave fashion trendsetter, there’s no question he is a modern day cultural icon. When not busy spreading a blend of dark new wave techno to worldwide audiences, designing for his fashion lines, or manning his powerhouse label <em>Deejay Gigolos</em>, you can find DJ Hell in the studio doing what he does best - concocting cutting-edge new music for the masses.</p>
<p>Following his intoxicating masterpiece <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teufelswerk</span>, he is riding high with the smash single “U Can Dance” featuring vocals from glam rock darling, Bryan Ferry.  The anthemic single features a slew of cutting edge remixes from the likes of Carl Craig, Tim Goldsworthy, and electro superstars Simian Mobile Disco.  It has charted high around the world including a spot on the Time Out New York’s T<em>op 10 Club Music of 2009</em> charts, 5 stars from <em>DJ Mag</em>, landing at #1 for 2 consecutive weeks on <em>DMC BUZZ Chart</em>, as well as being  nominated for the respected 2010 <em>Echo Awards</em>.</p>
<p>New York dance music veteran<strong> Abe Duque</strong> is the self described “<em>oldest new guy on the scene</em>”.  His 20 + year career has spanned the spectrum of what a DJ and producer can achieve, while maintaining the underground image that so many wish to keep.  From Limelight to Tresor, the dark acid basslines, Latin percussion, deep-house grooves, ethereal electronica and piano instrumentals that make up Duque’s sound have been showcased around the world.  His latest album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Be So Mean</span> combines dance floor friendly tunes with Abe’s meditative side to produce an eclectic full length album.  <em>Pacha Ibiza</em> and <em>Cielo</em> resident <strong>Willie Graff</strong> has the sounds of electronic music pumping through his veins.  Being born on the white isle, the <em>Playtime</em> resident brings his trademark brand of deep, moody house music to his Mediterranean home during the summer and the booth of his adopted hometown of New York throughout the year.</p>
