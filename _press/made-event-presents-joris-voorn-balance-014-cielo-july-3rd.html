<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>

<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
JORIS VOORN</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents Holland’s shinning star <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on Friday,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> July 3, 2009</strong></span>, following the release of his stunning 2xCD <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 014</span> compilation on EQ Recordings.</p>
<p>Dutch DJ/Producer <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> is hotly tipped as the next big thing, with the release of his magnificent Balance 014 compilation. Across two discs and using – remarkably – over 100 tracks, Joris constructs a complex, layered and seamless mix of some of the best tech house, minimal and electronic dance music. An epic mix in the very best sense of the word, Joris achieves the rare feat of combining variety and consistency, both on the album and on dancefloors alike. This Labor Day weekend, sparks will fly as the Dutch star makes his return to NYC.</p>
<p>Performing a yet near impossible task of making 100 tracks mesh and work together in 2 continuous mixes, Joris Voorn draws on a depth of talent unlikely to be repeated on a mix CD compilation. It takes a visionary DJ to combine tracks from Radiohead, through to Goldie, Leftfield, Jimpster, Aphex Twin, Dubfire, System 7, Minilogue, Cobblestone Jazz, Emmanuel Top, Joakim, Âme, Mood II Swing, Ricardo Villalobos, Radio Slave, Carl Craig, Flying Lotus, Marc Romboy, Robert Babicz, Tiger Stripes just to name a few. This isn't a CD you skip through. In some cases one track is in fact 6 different tracks from various artists. By allowing the tracks breathe at the right time, Joris crafts the mix ever so smoothly; riding along without you even noticing that you are passing from tune to tune. It's all about the subtle transitions, the loops, the multiple layers that make Balance 014 a musical composition in its own right.</p>
<p>“<em>Balance 014 is unlike any mix compilation and fans of the series will appreciate the beautifully eclectic collection of music, the innovative blends, and the superb technical skills this set presents</em>”.- <strong>Image Magazine</strong></p>
<p>"<em>Essentially following the Richie Hawtin blueprint of mixing many tracks  at once into entirely new  morasses of beautiful noise, over the course of two CDS Voorn melts lush tech-house, minimal techno, deep electronica, folk and much more into a perfectly judged voyage across widescreen vistas, quite stunning in their scope.  This is truly DJing 2.0 - Joris Voorn belongs in the pantheon of dancefloor titans for this instant classic.</em>" – <strong>DJ Mag</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Next to being a showcase of Joris' incredible skills, Balance 014 is among the best in its series and one of the hottest compilations to appear these months.</em>” -<strong>365Mag</strong></p>
<p>“<em>It is one of those rare CD’s that you can’t fast forward even 8 bars or you might miss something.  In many cases, 1 track is actually several tracks from different artists.  He might just use a small loop from one, a break from another and so on and so on.  This is a very intense journey through some of the best tech house, minimal and electronic music out there.</em>”-<strong>DJ Times</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Voorn’s hand at marrying club anthems with ambient interludes is a gift to the series, and raises the bar for future compilations.</em>”-<strong>EDGE</strong></p>
