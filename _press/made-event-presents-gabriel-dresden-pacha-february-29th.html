<strong><br />
Gabriel &amp; Dresden</strong>'s Organized Nature are set to release their exclusive G&amp;D remix for Monochrome "Pearl". After judging the Heineken Thirst Competition, they selected the Romanian winner, Monochrome "Pearl", and decided to go into the studio together. Next up the duo go back to the basics with Gabriel &amp; Dresden's "New Path" with a range of remixes from Dave Aude, Trent Cantrelle and Pete Heller among others. Following that, the label will issue the second release from Deep Flexion entitled "Monologue" with mixes from Umek and Ozgur Can.</p>
<p>Late last year, Josh Gabriel's first solo single ahead of his debut artist album coming in 2008 burst onto the scene with a #12 ranking in DJ Mag's year end Top 100. The track Josh Gabriel "Summit" has garnered high praise, with airplay on Radio 1's Essential mix and top DJs like John Digweed describing it as "massive" and Armin Van Buuren calling it "techno evolved." Also, techno giant Carl Cox named it one of his favorite tunes of the year, while Sander Kleinenberg said "With this stormer [Josh] has nothing less than delivered a future classic. Brilliant."</p>
<p>Organized Nature is home to their critically acclaimed self-titled artist album released in 2006 with Billboard #1 Dance Club Chart hit singles "Tracking Treasure Down" and "Dangerous Power", along with nine other singles which have all been both commercially successful and embraced by critics. Now with 17 Billboard #1 Club Chart hits, Gabriel &amp; Dresden continue to tour the world playing the best clubs and festivals, and have earned respect and support globally of both fans and the world's top DJs by constantly pushing electronic music to the next level.
