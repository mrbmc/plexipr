<p style="text-align: justify;">Escaping the clutches of Hurricane Irene, <strong>Electric Zoo 2011</strong> emerged this Labor Day Weekend in full force, with 85,000 attendees from 102 countries and 51 states, enjoying beats from the world’s best electronic dance music artists over three sun-drenched days on Randall’s Island Park in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 100 DJs and live acts provided the finest techno, trance, house, dubstep, electro and indie dance music across four stages. From iconic headliners <strong>Tiësto, David Guetta</strong> and <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> along with <strong>Moby, John Digweed</strong> and <strong>Richie Hawtin</strong>, to newer talents like <strong>SBTRKT, Porter Robinson, 12th Planet, Michael Woods</strong> and <strong>Arty</strong>, Electric Zoo celebrated America’s exploding obsession with dance music. <strong>Skrillex’s</strong> epic stage dive, <strong>Tiësto's</strong> confetti shower, thousands singing along to <strong>David Guetta’s</strong> tunes, an appearance by Snoop Dogg’s DJ alter-ego <strong>DJ Snoopadelic</strong>, and<strong>Armin van Buuren’s</strong> closing set complete with fireworks are just a few notable moments from what’s now established as one of the premiere electronic music festivals in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To top off its stellar lineup, Electric Zoo went next level with spectacular visuals, from the <em>Hilltop Arena’s</em> massive custom-designed concave LED wall and the <em>Red Bull Riverside’s</em> mixed media playback cubes to Gizem Bacaz’s meditative <em>Garden of EZ</em> with Kate Raudenbush’s laser-cut steel <em>Braindrop</em>. Not to mention the dust-free tents, plethora of organic food choices, and no lines at the festival entrance, thanks to RFID wristband technology.</p>

<p><em>"Only the most serious-minded electronic music fans stream onto Randall's Island. Now in its third year, the good-natured festival continues to offer a smart, varied crew of the best D.J.s and </em><em>live dance acts in the world."</em> <strong>—The New York Times </strong></p>
<p><em>"Randall’s Island became a multiplex of temporary dance floors, with a stadium-scale stage for </em><em>headliners and three tents with club-quality surround-sound systems.”</em> <strong>—Jon Pareles, The New York Times </strong></p>
<p><em>“Capping off a summer that saw the biggest electronic music events in U.S. history, Electric Zoo </em><em>marked its third and biggest year yet.” </em> <strong>—Billboard.com </strong></p>
<p><em>“The fest that began as a modest weekend event was something more, drawing crowds that </em><em>were large even by music festival standards.”</em> <strong>—The Wall Street Journal </strong></p>
<p><em>“The three-day dance party on Randall's Island had no shortage of new: New acts, new tracks and new grass (really!) filled the 24-acre island for 12 hours a day over Labor Day weekend... Despite the record number of attendees — over 85,000 fans showed up — Electric Zoo didn't lose its sense of ease and comfort. Thanks to an increased number of restrooms, a variety of food vendors and the use of RFID wristband technology, which minimized entrance time, there were no lines to be found. And when you wanted to dance deep inside the tent, there was an actual dance floor and ample space to do so. When you're talking about music marathons, these are small details that many festival producers overlook, the small details that can turn a great event into an exceptional one. </em><em>”</em> <strong>—Huffington Post </strong></p>
<p><em>“While it certainly is a spectacle, Electric Zoo was probably the happiest place on earth last </em><em>weekend.”</em> —<strong>Village Voice</strong></p>
<p><em> “...A line-up that reads like a who’s who of the electronic music world with Tiësto, David Guetta, </em><em>Richie Hawtin and Luciano all playing.”</em>  <strong>—Mixmag </strong></p>
<p><em>"I felt like I was playing the finals of the champions league or the superbowl. It was THAT big. WOW!"</em> <strong> —Armin van Buuren</strong></p>
<p><em>“Electric Zoo was sick!  The crowd was unbelievable and brought an incredible energy to the </em><em>city.”</em> —<strong>Tiësto </strong></p>
<p><em>“As last year, Electric Zoo was totally amazing. To play in such an amazing city like New York, in front of ten thousand dancing and screaming people is a real highlight of my year I really </em><em>enjoyed.”</em> —<strong>ATB </strong></p>
<p><em><em>“It’s incredible to gather all those people for an EDM event like Electric Zoo. I'm very excited to </em><em>follow the progression of house music in US when events like this turn out they way it did.”</em> —</em><em><strong>John Dahlback </strong></em></p>
<p><em>“We've watched EZ become in 3 years something with a lot of promise into a festival that is paid attention to all over the globe. The line-ups are a good cross section of what's really happening </em><em>in dance music as well as a few cool and interesting surprises.”</em> —<strong>Gabriel &amp; Dresden</strong></p>
<p><em>“It was massive, and as an artist is always nice to be part of that, sometimes you look around </em><em>and say, ‘wow I’m playing here'.”</em> —<strong>Guti </strong></p>
<p><em>“I felt like playing Electric Zoo advanced me as an artist.” —<strong>Porter Robinson </strong></em></p>
<p><em>"It was not only incredible as a performer but so much fun as a spectator. The collection of artists that performed was one of the best lineups I've seen in a while, let alone been a part of."</em> —<strong>Nick from Super Mash Bros</strong></p>
