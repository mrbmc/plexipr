TOCADISCO</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the production sensation from Cologne, Germany,<strong> Tocadisco</strong> for his <strong>Cielo</strong> debut on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, April 10th, 2009. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Tocadisco</strong>, aka Roman B. has chosen to live in Cologne, Germany which may be well known for its underground minimal sound, yet far from being the axis of modern day contemporary culture, or even any sort of house music. Perfect for an artist to silently work in solitude, not facing the daily distractions of a city that never sleeps such as New York, London, Madrid. Living in peace and quiet lends itself to productivity and creativity, allowing Tocadisco to churn out hit after hit. He has been producing music exactly the way he wants to, all the while gaining world wide acclaim from DJ's, producers, and clubbers  alike. One look at his lengthy discography will tell you he has remixed for and been remixed by the industries heavyweights including Mylo, David Guetta, M.A.N.D.Y. vs Booka Shade, Martin Solveig, and Robbie Rivera.</p>
<p>After his critically acclaimed first album, Solo, Tocadisco has a follow up due out in the next few months. Tocadisco's new album, slated to be an even bigger release, with a slew of remixes for the biggest names in dance music. He will be showcasing some exclusive new tracks from the album all night at Cielo, so expect the most upfront and freshest cuts of prime 'hands in the air' glory.</p>
