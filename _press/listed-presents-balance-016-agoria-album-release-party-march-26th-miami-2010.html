<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Listed</strong></em> presents the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Balance 016: Agoria</strong></span> album release party with <strong>Agoria</strong> for his Miami debut, and Balance artists <strong>Joris Voorn</strong>, <strong>Will Saul</strong>, <strong>Desyn Masiello</strong>, <strong>Luke Fair</strong>, <strong>Chris Fortier</strong>, and <strong>Emerson Todd</strong>, along with special guests<strong> Three</strong>, along with Listed's <strong>Dory</strong> &amp; <strong>Hac Le</strong> and EQ Recordings' <strong>Tom Pandzic</strong> @ <strong>Hotel Victor</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, March 26th, 2010</strong></span> during WMC week.</p>
<p>After raising the bar to unprecedented heights in 2009 with <em>Joris Voorn</em> and <em>Will Saul</em>’s stunning additions to the series, EQ Recordings’ <em><strong>Balance</strong></em> series returns for the new decade with yet another standard-setting mix from one of the most sophisticated and inspiring names in techno, Frenchman - <strong>Agoria</strong>.</p>
<p>The man otherwise known as <strong>Sebastien Devaud</strong> wasn’t bitten by the dance music bug until he was out of his teens, but once he began hunting imported 12”s from the US and Germany in his native France, there was no turning back. His production career began in 1999, with his debut album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blossom </span>and first compilation following in 2003 – and it was clear even in those early days that a serious new talent was emerging. His 2007 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At The Controls</span> compilation set a new standard for minimal tech-house with its impeccable programming and seductive mixing. Now with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 016</span>, Agoria continues to blend the throb and groove of deeper, stripped-back techno with a keen sense of musicality, emotion and atmosphere, his is a sound that transcends beyond mere dancefloor disposability.</p>
<p>Agoria explains his intention for this intricate compilation: “<em>The concept of both CDs is all about balance. Literally. In my mind a balance is not a middle position; it's a perfect equilibrium. I’m trying to be as close as possible to this idea. I have tried to find this fine line where the balance is just right.</em>” To accomplish this perfectly-weighted contrast, he’s cherry-picked from a myriad of genres and subgenres in his “<em>beat open-minded</em>” fashion, combining a wealth of material from newcomers across the spectrum (including no less than 12 exclusives!) with more established producers, classics and unknown gems from his broad musical past, and put it all together in an unconventional, challenging manner. “<em>In the end, more than a DJ compilation, this is a manifesto of my passion for music and for mixing</em>” he explains.</p>
<p>Joining Agoria for this exclusive event will be a slew of past Balance artists.  <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> released one of the most well received Balance editions.  His 100+ tracklist of exclusive edits, chops, and mixes single handedly raised the bar for all future mix compilations.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 15</span> saw <strong>Will Saul</strong> bring an eclectic mix of his trademark <em>discohousetechno</em> sound.  His 3 CD’s worth of music travelled the landscape of sounds that Will is capable of playing.    As part of the SOS collective, <strong>Desyn Masiello</strong> (Balance 013) is known as a globetrotting DJ and consistent crowd favorite wherever he goes.  His music represents the finest that smooth house and techno have to offer and his DJ sets flow with the energy that comes from his own enthusiasm behind the decks. <strong> Luke Fair</strong> (Balance 011) has gone from a Canadian favorite to a worldwide DJ hero quite a small amount of time.  His sound encompasses all things house, featuring melodic landscapes, as well as thick basslines.    <strong>Chris Fortier </strong>(Balance 007) has maintained a solid career in dance music which spans nearly two decades.  His sound incorporates everything from progressive to minimal and just about everything in between.  A favorite of crowds and DJ’s alike; Chris Fortier is able to call himself one of the most respected figures in the game.   <em>Cocoon</em> and <em>Dirtybird</em> favorite <strong>Emerson Todd</strong> has enjoyed a spike in his artistic profile recently with a slew of residencies, releases, and international gigs.  The native New Zealander’s style can best be described as rolling tech house.  This is surely a name to look out for quite some time. The perennial favorite DJ's DJ,  Three joins the Balance soiree as a very special guest, along with Listed's <strong>Dory</strong> &amp; <strong>Hac Le</strong> and<em> EQ Recordings</em> label head Aussie <strong>Tom Pandzic</strong>.</p>
