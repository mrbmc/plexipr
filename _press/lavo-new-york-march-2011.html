<p><strong>Saturday, March 5 – BART B MORE</strong><br />
Netherland’s Bart B More is one of the brightest new stars in the international electronic music scene. His refreshing cross-over sound, which combines beat-driven, looped techno music with big room house and electro, has resulted in a number of dancefloor destroyers that have received massive support from the biggest DJs around the world, including Laidback Luke, Crookers, A-Trak, Tiesto and Boys Noize. His original tracks and remixes have climbed to the top of the Beatport charts -- including "So It Goes" and a remix of Sandy Rivera's "Freak," both of which were crowned Pete Tong's Essential New Tunes. Bart has performed at some of the world’s most popular festivals, including Nocturnal Festival, Sunrise Festival and Mysteryland. He is also the founder of Secure Recordings, which has released records from Diplo, Riva Starr and Bingo Players and more.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, March 17 – CHUCKIE with Mitch LJ</strong><br />
Chuckie is the mastermind behind the Dirty Dutch phenomenon, famous for its addictive “house with an attitude influenced by hip hop” sound and global house music events. Chuckie’s monster tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” have been supported by the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Laidback Luke and Pete Tong. He has also remixed David Guetta and Bob Sinclar, among others, and has recently been spending time in the studio with the likes of T-Pain and Kelly Rowland. His busy touring schedule also includes playing headlining sets at some of the world’s biggest festivals as well as a monthly rotation on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ show. Chuckie is joined by Mitch LJ, an accomplished jazz drummer who became a DJ in 2000, then immediately rose to be one of Europe’s most sought-after talents. Hailing from the South of France, he earned a stint as Nikki Beach St. Tropez’s Official DJ, representing the brand worldwide. Since then, he has taken his sexy and uplifting house music sets to San Paolo, Moscow, Frankfurt, Madonna’s afterparty in London, Pamela Anderson’s wedding and now New York City, where he currently lives. Both Chuckie and Mitch are returning to LAVO New York for what’s guaranteed to be one of the March’s most spectacular musical tag teams.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, March 19 – RONY SEIKALY</strong><br />
Formerly known as “The Spin Doctor,” ex-NBA superstar Rony Seikaly is now known as a DJ/producer with a raw talent for spinning a unique style of body-shaking house music with touches of trance-inflected melody lines, dynamic tribal rhythms and a soulful vibe. His diverse DJing style comes his varied musical knowledge, which includes rock, classical, disco, hip hop and R&amp;B, and all comes together in what loosely defines it as “happy underground.”  A longtime partner in clubs around the Miami area, Seikly now spins at hot spots around the world like LIV (Miami), Pacha (NYC) and Amnesia (Ibiza). Last year, he signed with Erick Morillo’s Subliminal Records and released his debut artist album, Subliminal Essentials Presents: House Calls by Rony Seikaly. This global dance album includes underground-influenced tracks like “Ignition” and “Session 13” as well as high energy bangers like “Carry The Light.” Rony’s previous night at LAVO New York was a sexy club music paradise, and he’s back to do it all over again.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, March 24 – EC TWINS with Steve Powers</strong><br />
Named after a successful club they once created in the U.K. (Eye Candy), the EC Twin’s European dance-influenced house music and energetic performances have earned them passionate fan bases from Northern Europe to South East Asia. Hailing from Manchester, the handsome and talented duo have performed at the hottest nightclubs and festivals around the world. Their long list of production work includes their hit remix of Andy Caldwell’s “Scream,” “Doing it Well” with Tim B of Second Sun and Paul Harris, and more on Oakenfold’s Perfecto label. Known for their wildly kinetic sessions at Guys and Dolls in Los Angeles, they are set to electrify the dancefloor at LAVO New York.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, March 31 – TATIANA FONTES</strong><br />
Tatiana Fontes returns to wow the crowd with her fusion of the ‘80s and rock from her youth (Duran Duran, The Cure, and the like), along with European house and electronic music, drawn from her years working as an international model. The Brazilian-born DJ grew up in the music business, with a father who owned a nightclub and brothers who were professional DJs. Though she traveled the globe to places like Paris, Milan and Japan to do major campaigns, editorials and fashion shows, and was cast in Oliver Stone’s Any Given Sunday as well as a 2005 Pepsi campaign alongside Eva Longoria, Tatiana longed to return to her true passion of music. Now residing in Los Angeles, Tatiana DJs regularly at the hottest clubs and parties around the world, from Mexico and Brazil to Bali, Italy, Russia, England and beyond. She has also worked alongside the industry’s best, including Erick Morillo, Sharam, Bob Sinclair, Dirty South, Armand Van Helden, Cedric Gervais and Markus Schulz.</p>
