<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The 6th Annual Club World Awards 2008 Winners<br />
Star-studded ceremony is the program's best yet<br />
<em>Big winners include New York, David Guetta, Peter Gatien, and Las Vegas video</em></strong></p>
<p>The Club World Awards, the only awards show that celebrates excellence in North American nightlife, reached new heights in this, its sixth year. On Wednesday, March 26, a crowd of 600 nightlife industry-ites and dance music glitterati gathered at what would soon be named "Best Lounge" and "Best Interior Design" winner - Opium Group venue Set, in Miami Beach - to hand out the awards.</p>
<p>The 2008 winners represented a healthy cross-section of nightlife. Standout winners include world clubbing capital New York City for "Best Superclub" - Pacha NYC, "Best Club" - Cielo, and "Best Party" - Dance.Here.Now.; Miami for Set's two wins, and "Best Renovation" - Cameo; Las Vegas for "Best Bottle Service" - Tao; and Toronto for Peter Gatien's clubbing comeback, "Best New Venue" - Circa. Jet Las Vegas solidified its position as the best place in the U.S. for high-tech visuals, taking the "Best Resident VJ" and "Best Video System" awards. Lush house jock Kaskade bested New York legend Louie Vega for the "Best Resident DJ" title, for his monthly stint at Smart Bar in Chicago.</p>
<p>This year, the expanded awards program also included three new People's Choice categories, determined by online public voting: "Club Banger Of The Year" (instrumental), which went to Fedde Le Grand's "Put Your Hands Up For Detroit"; "Club Anthem Of The Year" (vocal), won by David Guetta's "Love Is Gone"; and "Ultra Records Presents Best DJ Set," won by Danny Tenaglia for the Vinyl Reunion at Pacha New York, on April 6, 2007. In a surprise online windfall, the Garden State's Deko Lounge took the "NightStalker Award" for fan-favorite venue, also decided by online voting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, Dutch superstar Don Diablo hosted the first Technology &amp; Engineering Awards ceremony, honoring manufacturers Allen &amp; Heath, Chauvet, Martin Professional, Pioneer and Turbosound for their extraordinary lighting, sound, DJ and effects products.</p>
<p>The crowd was treated to a fresh-from-the-plant CD of exclusive dance remixes of Mariah Carey's new single "Touch My Body," caffeinated vodka from P.I.N.K., and a performance by Om Records starlet Samantha James. Among those presenting and attending were: ATB, Cedric Gervais, Chris Willis, Colette, Crystal Waters, Danny Krivit, D:Fuse, David Guetta, DJ Heather, DJ Rap, Don Diablo, Erika Jayne, Fedde Le Grand, Infected Mushroom, Kaskade, Larry Tee, Princess Superstar, The Scumfrog, Tommy Lee, Shapeshifters and more.</p>
<p>The nominees were selected from a pool of online submissions by the Club World editorial staff, with winners determined by a 12-person industry-veteran, expert panel of judges, except for the four People's Choice categories.</p>
<p>The Club World Awards is presented by Club Word (formerly Club Systems International), a magazine for the professional nightlifer. Launched in July 2000, the monthly publication covers the world's best venues from technical, business and aesthetic perspectives.</p>
