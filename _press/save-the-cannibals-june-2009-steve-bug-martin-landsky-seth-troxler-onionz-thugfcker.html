<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>JUNE 2 - STEVE BUG with PLEXUS</strong><br />
With an anticipated fourth LP on the way, <em>Poker Flat</em> head <strong>Steve Bug</strong> will be making his triumphant return to Save the Cannibals in June.  The original Cannibals resident marked the debut of this Saturday techno weekly in style over the winter and now is back to kick off the summer clubbing season.  His latest LP <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Collaboratory</strong></span> will be released in early June.  Based strongly on the ideas of collaboration, shared ideas, mutual respect for fellow artists and the strength of combining forces in the studio, Steve chose some very special producers and vocalists to work with on this exciting project.   Joining Steve on this night will be Minus cohort <strong>Plexus</strong>, a favorite around the New York minimal scene and beyond.  Plexus' brand of dub infused minimalism has brought him notoriety from some of the scenes heaviest hitters, as well as notable gigs throughout the world.</p>

<p><strong>JUNE 13 - MARTIN LANDSKY with TAIMUR</strong><br />
Another of Cannibals favorite residents will be making his return to the DJ booth of Rebel this month.  <strong>Martin Landsky</strong> is widely considered to be a member of the upper ranks of the techno community.  His penchant for deep music mixed with funky elements and sexy vocals make the Intim boss a favorite of clubbers worldwide.  With stand out sets from around the world, Martin Landsky will take to the decks and show New York City a sound that bridges techno, funk, minimal, and house.  Keep a lookout for Martin’s remix of f.e.x.’ “Can U Feel It” available on <em>Robotronic</em>.  <strong>Taimur</strong>'s  has cut his DJing chops with the best of the best.  For the last 3 years g his Blk|Market Membership parties have brought in members of the techno elite as well as the unsung heroes of the underground and undiscovered techno talent from around the globe to venues all across the city, Miami, and Detroit.</p>

<p><strong>JUNE 20- SETH TROXLER with ERIC CLOUTIER </strong><br />
An artist who seems to be everywhere at the moment is back this month after his successful Cannibals debut.  Everyone’s favorite Berlin/Detroit transplant<strong> Seth Troxler </strong>is further proving why <em>Resident Advisor</em> had chosen him as an artist to watch for in 2009. He has provided dance floors with a string of smash hits on leading labels like <em>Wagon Repair</em>, <em>Spectral Sound</em>, and<em> Crosstown Rebels</em>.  His latest the 'Aphrika' EP on Brooklyn's <em>Wolf + Lamb Music </em>is two parts. The namesake on part one is rife with poetic justice with words borrowed from Maya Angelou's "Phenomenal Woman" and part two from Nicolas Jaar is a minimal techno stormer with a remix by Seth. With DJ dates at some of the best clubs the world over, this rising star is quickly cementing his place as one of techno’s most original and forward thinking representatives. Another Detroit transplant, <strong>Eric Cloutier</strong> will provide the support on this night.  Eric has been quite busy of late with a constant DJ schedule and a new EP on the way Eric is finding himself amongst New York’s techno elite.</p>

Save The Cannibals introduces two new members into the tribe; <strong>Onionz </strong>and <strong>ThugF*cker</strong>.  A New York City native, Onionz is a no stranger to the scene with over 30 years of music under his belt, a heavy DJ touring itinerary, and releases on some of the most groundbracking record lables out there. Onionz has definitely kept up with the music beat of the world, in his own words, “to keep it fresh, you just have to continuously create and consistently rock it!” Th*gfucker AKA Holmar Filipsson &amp; Greg Oreck have recently wrapped up recording sessions in Rome for their upcoming album and will be finalizing the mixing in NYC, soon to be released on <em>Th*gfucker Records</em> with their unique combination of Tech House, Electro, and Minimal.</p>
