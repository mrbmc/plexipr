DIRTY SOUTH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents white hot Australian house DJ/Producer <strong>DIRTY SOUTH</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, November 8th</strong></span>.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to name a new artist who has had more impact on the scene over the last couple of years than <strong>Dirty South</strong> aka Dragan Roganovic.Â  It was 2006 and Dirty South's killer remix of Evermore's "It's Too Late" that his career really began to skyrocket. The remix was easily among the year's biggest tracks in clubland and in addition to being licensed to over 30 compilations worldwide, the track was nominated for 'Best Alternative Dance Release' at the International Dance Music Awards in Miami. Since that pivotal moment Dirty South has gone on to remix countless world renowned artists such as Depeche Mode, Mark Ronson, Tracy Thorn, Snoop Dogg, Tiesto and Roger Sanchez among many others. By no means purely a remix specialist, Dirty South has produced an impressive number of high quality EPs and singles. "Let It Go", "Open Your Heart", "Minority" and The Doors sampling "The End" have been all been club-smashing anthems that have received support from right across the board.</p>
<p>Continuing their policy of investing in white-hot, breakthrough talent, Toolroom Records enlisted Australian DJ/producer Dirty South to provide a mix for the prolific Toolroom Knights series. After efforts from label boss Mark Knight and Radio 1 DJ Dave Spoon, the series is quickly garnering a reputation for cutting-edge mixes that push the boundaries of House music.</p>
