DAVE DRESDEN (Gabriel &amp; Dresden)<br />
with Alterimage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents <strong>Dave Dresde</strong>n (formerly of Gabriel &amp; Dresden) for his solo debut at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, August 29th, 2008.</span></strong></p>
<p>Back in 2001, <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> partnered with Josh Gabriel to form the internationally successful DJ/production duo, Gabriel &amp; Dresden. Soon after the group formed, they gained recognition through their numerous remixes for dance tracks including Tiesto's "In My Memory" and pop titles including "Don't Leave Home" by Dido and "Intuition" and "Serve the Ego" by Jewel. Their first single, "Lament", was released to much critical acclaim in 2002 on Satoshi Tomiie's Saw Recordings. In 2006, their self titled debut studio album was named as the "2006 Album of the Year" by M8 magazine.</p>
<p>Dresden's contribution to the duo led to 18 No. 1 positioned singles and remixes (and two others with both Chris Cox and Attention Deficit) on Billboard's Club Play Chart. The worldwide smash hit which Dresden released with Josh and Motorcycle, "As the Rush Comes," hit the #1 spot on the US's Dance Radio Airplay chart in 2004 and No. 11 in the UK national singles chart. As DJs, Gabriel &amp; Dresden reached No. 20 on the prestigious DJ Magazine Poll for 2006 and Best American DJ in 2007 and 2008 at the Annual Winter Music Conference International Dance Music Awards. Gabriel &amp; Dresden parted ways in March of 2008.</p>
<p>Now embarking on his solo career, Dresden continues to accelerate and his various successes have allowed him to remix artists including The Killers, Britney Spears &amp; Madonna, Paul Oakenfold, and many more.</p>
