<p align="center"><strong> Cielo ‘Cinco’ E-card (Preview Album <a href="http://www.tommyboy.com/media/Email_HTML.html">Here</a>)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Summer edges ever closer in the city and Cielo continues to feel the heat with an all star line-up of international guests and local heroes to ring in the new season.</p>
<p>Things kick off on Tuesday 3rd with our Adult Section night hosting the talents of Metro Area’s Darshan Jesrani. <strong>Metro Area</strong> burst onto the scene almost a decade ago, the brainchild of veteran producers Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani, born out of the duo’s dichotomous love of both the old moods of R&amp;B, disco and boogie and the more cutting-edge sound of innovative house and techno. Detroit-esque futurism, Chicago’s abstract tracks, and the warmth of New York and New Jersey’s deep house are all part of the MA experience. Meanwhile Citizen Kane is on hand to add their own styling to proceedings on a night that promises to start things off in style.</p>
<p>Another month and another birthday celebration at Dance Here Now - on the 5th it’s <strong>Tom Stephan</strong>’s turn to blow out the candles. The thirty-something DJ/producer is another Big Apple native that morphed into his now internationally known Superchumbo protagonist guise, creating and playing his trademark mind-enveloping sound collages of darker percussive elements, dark twisted drums and mesmerizing tension building house sets.</p>
<p>On the 6th Playtime presents Big Love featuring <strong>Seamus Haji</strong>. Haji is the man behind the creative output of the Brighton-based Big Love label, and a pop star in his own right having scored several UK hits including an update of ‘Last Night A DJ Saved My Life’, and most recently working with hip-house don Doug Lazy. A master at weaving disco-inflected grooves that are fluffy enough for pop sensibilities, yet muscular enough to generate some much-needed street appeal, Haji’s sets similarly mix ‘n’ match the new with the old, and the underground with the crossover.</p>
<p>Now into its third month, don’t forget that Freedom on June 8th is the new and exclusive NYC monthly residency for <strong>Junior Vasquez</strong>.</p>
<p>Deep Space on the 9th finds<strong> Francois K</strong> on deck duty. Reams and reams could be said of the man who’s been filling dancefloors as a DJ, remixer and producer since the late-70s. But Philly hit-man King Britt neatly sums things up when he says: “He’s the only person to bring remixing full circle from late-70s to present and has revolutionized the way we listen to sound.” He’s joined on the night by a live set from Norway’s <strong>Bugge Wesseltoft</strong>. Since the early-90s Bugge (conveniently pronounced Boogie!) has made an impressive, truly post-modern transition from Nordic jazz to create a style he refers to as “future jazz” which sits equally well with fans of deep-house and techno, as well as traditional and experimental jazz purists. There’s a $12 cover charge on the night that runs from 10pm-3:30am.</p>
<p>LA-based house head <strong>Marques Wyatt</strong>’s summer monthly residency, Deep, commences on June 13th with what promises to another self-assured night of deep soulful grooves and uplifting gospel-etched house.</p>
<p>Cielo resident <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> is sure to drop tracks from the new Cielo compilation ‘Cinco’ on Thursday 14th at Paradizo. ‘Cinco’ is a celebration of our fifth anniversary, to be released July 8th on Tommy Boy with each disc mixed by residents Nicolas Matar and Willie Graff respectively. UK’s Update Magazine just awarded it 5 Dancin’ Men and referred to it as “a sleek, sexy, soul-soothing collection featuring new music and remixes from the likes of Carl Craig, Ultra Nate, Arnold Jarvis, Swayzak, Kenny Bobien, K-Scope, Charles Webster, Nick Holder, Alix Alvarez, DJ Pippi, Justin Martin and Manoo &amp; Francois A, and a dozens more beside across 2CDs. In a time where we’re increasingly being told to find new ways to let off stream from the riggers of city living, this comes as the ideal tonic.”</p>
<p><strong>Harry “Choo Choo” Romero</strong> returns to Cielo on Thursday for 19th Dance Here Now. The former Subliminal man’s sets are legendary as HCCR drops a funk-infused blend of burbling electro-etched basslines, twisted tribalism, and darker progressiveness. The night runs from 10pm-4am and promises set to be a sell out, so to avoid disappointment $20 advance tickets are available from <a href="http://www.danceherenownyc.com" target="_blank">www.danceherenownyc.com</a>.</p>
<p>Another guaranteed sellout on Friday 20th sees Basic New York welcome <strong>Jody Wisternoff</strong> and guests Sleepy and Boo. Jody made his name in Way Out West, one of the key progressive house acts for over a decade, with a handful of acclaimed albums to their name. After achieving commercial success and critical acclaim as a producer, remixer and DJ, 2006 saw him release his first single under his own name, which quickly topped the Beatport download listing winning new friends in the process. As a DJ he quick to say he “embraces the exciting fresh sounds, shunning the populist/lowest common denominator fodder”. Little wonder his musical passion has always kept him ahead of the game. With support dates alongside Derrick Carter, Mark Farina and Terry Frances, Basic New York resident’s Sleepy and Boo’s credentials speak volumes. The attendance is a no-brainer! (The night runs 11pm-4am, with advance tickets $15 from <a href="http://www.wantickets.com">www.wantickets.com</a> or $20 on the door)</p>
<p>There’s more Deep Space on the 23rd with <strong>DJ Spinna</strong> headlining the night. Known to his mum as Vince Williams, the Brooklyn resident by his own account is “something of an anomaly in music. A humbling example of what it takes to truly succeed within the framework of multiple fields. A steadfast work ethic, an obsessively extensive vinyl library and the willingness to pursue the full extents of his roots (funk, soul and jazz), foundation (hip-hop) and future (electronic/dance music) with no restraints.” Musically he plays all of the above with a verve and passion few can match, let along better. (The night runs 10pm-3:30am with a $12 cover).</p>
<p>Dance Here Now chalks up its first year on Thursday 26th with an anniversary party featuring a trio of legends of New York house -<strong> Danny Krivit, Hex Hector, and Tedd Patterson</strong>. We could list their credentials that include Grammy Awards, acclaimed and innovative remixes and guaranteed places booked in House Music’s Hall of Fame – but come hear for yourself on the must attend night of the month (10pm-4am, $20 advance tickets from <a href="http://www.danceherenownyc.com" target="_blank">www.danceherenownyc.com</a>). Incidentally Tedd Patterson is the monthly Vibal resident that is on the 7th this month.</p>
<p>Things round off on the 27th with the monthly Made Event featuring a live showcase from Jake Fairley under his <strong>Fairmont</strong> alter ego or his “soft side” as Canadian techno-meister likes to call it. His songs evoke heartache and lonely nights, making listeners smile or cry depending on how their day’s going. Fairmont’s midtempo live act is deep and danceable, yet friendly and personal and has to be witness first hand to be fully understood. (Advance tickets are $15 from <a href="http://www.made-event.com">www.made-event.com</a>).</p>
