<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FERRY CORSTEN UNVEILS NEW ALBUM &amp; CONCEPT TOUR<br />
‘ONCE UPON A NIGHT’</strong><br />
(Ultra Music, March 30th)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dutch dance music pioneer<strong> Ferry Corsten</strong> unveils <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Once Upon A Night</strong></span>, his latest compilation and concept tour. It is built as a double disc set featuring 25 unreleased tracks, all of which have been produced by Ferry himself or his frequent collaborators exclusively for the compilation.  The album out March 30th on Ultra Music is an amalgam of the best in house and trance. Drawing influence from Corsten’s travels to the world’s most exotic destinations, listeners are transported on a journey through unchartered territories of sound.</p>
<p>On the new album Ferry says, “<em>I am happy to be back with a compilation after quite some years.  Because of the traveling and touring I get to see a lot of cultures.  These impressions have had a great influence on compiling this double album.  I personally think the mix is great fusion of house and trance combined in a two and half hour musical journey.</em>”  The album’s exclusive tracklisting is designed to bring the warmth of a tropical beach to even the coldest of winter nights.  With Ferry Corsten leading the way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once Upon A Night</span> marks the beginning of a new era in mixed compilations.  Let him lead you into the night…</p>
<p>To support the compilation, Ferry Corsten also unleashes the brand new tour concept: <em><strong>Once Upon A Night: The Experience</strong></em>.   Designed as a 6 hour interactive journey in 3 parts (sunset, night and sunrise), the show highlights the magic of the compilation visualized by a never before seen living backdrop.  Ferry will be accompanied by two major league DJ’s, who along with Ferry will lead the audience into the night. The interactive combination of sound and visuals will take the audience on a complete sensory experience with state-of-the-art production techniques - emulating sunset to sunrise; from dusk ‘til dawn; pre-party through after-party. <em>Once Upon A Night: The Experience </em>will be an amazing indulgence of the senses never before seen in a DJ performance.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Ferry Corsten has hosted the weekly radio show ‘<em><strong>Corsten’s Countdown</strong></em>’  on 22 worldwide radio stations and weekly on Sirius XM Radio Wednesdays at 9pm ET. The program is designed as a weekly chart show which puts the listener in control of the  playlist.  As Ferry plays the latest tracks from established and up-and-coming producers, listeners are able to vote for their favorites. During the month’s final show, Ferry presents the top 10 tracks based on previous weeks voting results.  Beginning in March 2010, the popular radio show will be available as a free weekly podcast. Every Thursday a brand new episode will be available for download via<a href="http://www.itunes.apple.com"> iTunes</a> and <a href="http://">www.ferrycorsten.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ferry Corsten has been nominated at this year’s <em><strong>International Dance Music Awards</strong></em> in the <strong>Best European DJ</strong> category and “<em><strong>Corsten’s Countdown</strong></em>” is nominated in the <strong>Best Radio Mix Show</strong> category.  As one of the most anticipated annual events on the global dance music calendar the IDMA’s generate votes worldwide from music enthusiasts around the globe.  With 57 award categories, the event honors exceptional achievements throughout the spectrum of dance music.</p>
<p>It's easy to get excessive when talking about DJs, but with dance music veteran and trance hero<strong> Ferry Corsten</strong>, the facts speak for themselves.  The accolades and awards he has received for his productions, remixes, and DJ skills have resulted in Ferry being voted as one of the Top 10 DJs in the world by DJ Magazine for almost a decade. Since his immersion on the scene in the late '90s, the Dutch musician has amassed best-selling albums and nearly a dozen gold singles.  He also maintains a worldwide tour schedule which, on any given weekend, brings him to all corners of the globe.  His albums, remixes, and singles reach iconic status almost immediately upon release as such iconic tracks as "Made of Love", "Punk", "Gouryella", and "Out of the Blue" can prove. His anthemic 2001 System F album,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Out of the Blue</strong></span> was recently re-released and digitally re-mastered featuring the complete track list and some hard to find remixes, along with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Out of the Blue 2010</strong></span>, which features the legendary trance anthem remixed by some of today’s top artists including Tiesto, Laidback Luke, and Giuseppe Ottaviani, amongst a slew of others. Now with 'One Upon A Night' hitting our shores, Ferry shows no signs of slowing down in 2010.</p>
