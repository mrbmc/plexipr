<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong>’s rise to fame started in his native New York, where he was a resident at every big room throughout the ‘90s, including Roxy, Limelight, Tunnel, Twilo and most notably at Vinyl, where his “Be Yourself” party allowed him to recreate the vibe of the club that had changed his life: The Paradise Garage. Tenaglia has been hailed as the "DJ's DJ," with awards that include the Dancestar Lifetime Achievement, Club World Awards Best Resident DJ and a GRAMMY nomination for Best Remixed Recording of Depeche Mode’s “I Feel Loved.” With a discography spanning over 20 years, Danny Tenaglia has altered the course of dance music history with his combination of classic, soulful groove and modern, club-ready depth, both at the decks and in the studio. He spins legendary sets as his fanbase has continues to grow worldwide. <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Italy’s <strong>Luca Bacchetti</strong> is one of the foremost proponents of the seminal swing sound coming from the peninsula and abroad. Currently residing in Barcelona, this DJ/producer spreads his signature twists and musical turns through myriad productions released and remixes on Ovum, Crosstown Rebels, Wagon Repair, Be As One, Supernature, Tenax, Safari Electronique, Sci+Tec and of course, Hideout Music, the label he runs with Davide Squillace. Named Beatport’s ‘Best Artist’ in 2008, his incomparable style showcases a unique ear for rarity, adding in a sexiness uncommon among his peers. Equally versed at moving a dark basement club to fits of revelry as he is to casting a deep shadow across a sunny beach party, his duality of emotion inspires his many releases and the clubbing masses from Berlin to Tokyo.</p>
