<p style="text-align: justify;">For those in NYC who would like to attend, limited spots are available by RSVP on the <a href="http://t.ymlp195.net/usmyyakawssavahebaiaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Facebook event page</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dubspot has found great success recently with their <strong>Mary Anne Hobbs</strong> and <strong>Soul Clap</strong> live streaming workshops, and are incredibly excited to welcome Kate for this next edition. Plus, Simko will be performing at the Hudson Bar on Sunday, May 15 with her visual artist, Jeffrey Weeter. Check out the show, and then find out how it’s all done the next day.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About Kate Simko</strong><br />
Although her music tends to appear on hip techno labels like Spectral and Hello? Repeat, Kate Simko’s music blurs the lines between techno, house, IDM and soundtrack scores to create soulful moments for different settings. From her work scoring the PBS documentary The Atom Smashers, to her melodic tech/house singles such as “Mind on You,” Simko always brings a fresh take on composition that combines a soulful approach to songwriting with modern drum programming for the dance floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On May 23<sup>rd</sup>, Kate Simko will release Lights Out, her first full-length solo release, on <em>Hello? Repeat</em> records. The album is an amalgam of house music, techno sounding percussion, funky bass lines, and soulful vocals – proper dance floor material. Kate also recently returned from a European tour to support the release, and continues with select US dates, including her May 15<sup>th</sup> gig in NYC, and a Movement 2011 Opening Party at Oslo in Detroit.<em> </em></p>
