<p><strong>Made Event</strong> has just added Dutch house hotshot <strong>Hardwell</strong> to the lineup and is pleased to announce that <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong> will be playing an <em>extended 4 hour set</em> when he returns to New York City’s Times Square for a night of sophisticated trance and house fusion at Best Buy Theater on <strong>Saturday, April 2, 2011</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Never  one to rest on his accolades, Ferry is back on the road right after  finishing his massive ‘Once Upon A Night’ world tour, which celebrated  the second release of his hugely popular compilation series by the same  name. It just goes to show that Ferry is the kind of international DJ  that legends are made of. Voted into the Top 10 of DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs  list for the past 5 years, he has established himself as a trailblazer  of trance and continues the tradition, selling out venues worldwide with  musical productions and DJ sets that combined trance, house, and  electro. The facts speak for themselves: since his immersion on the  scene in the late 1990s, Ferry has amassed best-selling albums, nearly a  dozen gold singles, and countless awards like 'Best Producer of the  Year' (Ericsson Music Awards) and 'Best Trance DJ' (Ibiza DJ Awards). He  has remixed tracks in all genres of music from U2, Faithless, The  Killers, Moby, Nelly Furtado, to Public Enemy and has collaborated with  dance and pop artists such as Duran Duran, William Orbit, Howard Jones,  Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Novastar and many more. Ferry is currently  nominated for an International Dance Music Award for 'Best Global DJ'.  He is also preparing his new artist album, which will be released later  this year.</p>

<div>
<p>When  not busy in the studio, Ferry can be found recording his weekly radio  show ‘Corsten’s Countdown,’ which is available for download at <a href="http://www.ferrycorsten.com/" target="_blank">www.ferrycorsten.com</a>.  Fans can also download the “Ferry Corsten app” to iPhone, Android and  BlackBerry to access the real-time world of Ferry Corsten as well as  interact with his online community 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>DJ, producer and label manager at only 23 years old, Netherland’s <strong>Hardwell</strong> is house music’s latest young star. Experiencing his first  international breakthrough in 2009 with his “Show Me Love vs. Be”  bootleg of Steve Angello and Laidback Luke’s track, Hardwell has gone on  to co-produce “Guess What” with Dutch house superstar Chuckie, as well  as remix the likes of Fedde Le Grand, Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Bob  Sinclar, Chris Lake, Sharam, Funkerman and more. Hardwell’s best-selling  Eclectic Beatz mix album was released in ten editions, and 2011 sees  new releases on his own Revealed Recordings label, a new compilation  series ‘Revealed’ (as a sequel to the success of ‘Eclectic Beatz’), and  remixes for Flo-Rida ft. Akon, Haley, Gareth Emery and more. Hardwell  has taken his exceptional technical skills and unique big room house  sound worldwide, from Sydney to Miami, Amsterdam to London. Last summer,  Hardwell made his Ibiza debut, invited by none other than Tiesto, with  whom he’s recently collaborated on the track “Zero 76.”</p>
