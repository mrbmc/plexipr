** Official CMJ <span style="color: #ff0000;">09</span> Event **</strong></p>
<p>As part of the <strong>CMJ Music Marathon <span style="color: #ff0000;">09</span></strong>, <strong>Roger Sanchez</strong> stages his long-waited return to <em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, October 24th, 2009.</strong></span></p>
<p>2009 has already been a remarkable year for <strong>Roger Sanchez </strong>with the release of two major mix compilations: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Roger Sanchez 3D</strong></span> for Renaissance and, most recently, the all-new double disc odyssey <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Release Yourself Volume 8</strong></span> on Roger’s own Stealth label. Part one is Roger’s Pre-Party collection. Here, making fine company for the likes of Faithless and Mike Monday, you have exclusive tracks from Tuccillo and Veerus &amp; Maxie Devine. Roger then moves up a gear with the Party selection, where exclusives roll in from Terry Viether &amp; Per QX, Chris Kaeser, Jesse Garcia, Tiko’s Groove, Da Hool and Zenker, and Martin Accorsi. Also through Stealth, Roger and Ibiza’s DJ Oliver (aka The Transatlatins) released a summer scorcher called “I Can’t Live Without Music”, which scored a #1 hit in the DMC Buzz Chart.</p>
<p>Throughout all these new and exciting developments, Roger has continued his hugely popular Podcast that boasts over 85,000 downloads per show.  In addition, Roger’s YouTube channel is constantly being updated with new interviews and live video footage from his events.</p>
