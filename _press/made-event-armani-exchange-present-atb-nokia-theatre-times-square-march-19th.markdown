<em>Made Event &amp; Armani Exchange present</em><br />
ATB<br />
@ Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>Armani Exchange</strong></em> continue their extraordinary experience of sound and vision with Germany’s trance superstar <strong>ATB</strong> at <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, March 19th, 2010</strong></span>.  The inaugural event was sizzling with energy from the time doors opened to a packed house welcoming  Ferry Corsten &amp; John Dahlbäck. The events' dazzling lights, expert sound, innovative sets and top quality music was on full display and you will surely not want to miss this next one-of-a-kind event.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of artists who can lay claim to over a decade’s worth of success in the world of dance music.  Yet, there are even less who can claim this achievement while consistently staying true to themselves and the music.   Germany’s <strong>ATB</strong> can call himself one of these true artists.  He is an electronic music representative who has presented his sound and spirit by way of 8 successful studio albums, 5 mix CD’s, and a jet setting DJ schedule that brings him to the world’s premier clubs and festivals.  From his breakout single “9PM (Till I Come)” to his latest 3 CD mix <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ATB THE DJ 5</strong></span>, Andre is widely known as a DJ who desires a close bond with fans, as well as the finest qualities in production, detail, and musicality.  All of ATB’s hard work does not go unnoticed.  His legions of adoring fans continually recognize this effort by voting him high amongst his peers in virtually every DJ poll and ranking available (#11 in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJ’s, #4 on The DJList.com).</p>
<p>Now, for the fifth time, ATB grants listeners an insight into what makes him adored the world over. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ATB THE DJ 5</span> represents his selection of the finest electronic dance music, mixed into three diverse sets. Like his previous mixes, this one allows listeners to participate in those emotional moments where ATB feels as close to his fans as is possible “The people surrounding me and the people in the clubs provide a constant feedback while I’m performing, so they are active in the creation of the set at every second. So therefore the sets I play are the product of all this input of all the people in the club. I think on the 3 CD’s of ‘<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ATB THE DJ 5</span>’ I successfully managed to capture and to express this special creative process, and I hope that listeners can enjoy listening to them.</em>”  The compilation consists of three distinct sets.  The first is presented with the sounds of the modern club in mind while disc 2 ventures into decidedly more progressive territory.  The final CD is a very special mix containing some of ATB’s all-time favorite’s mixed with exclusive remakes of his own classics“9 PM (Till I Come)”, “Gravity” and “L. A. Nights”.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> is an indoor theater designed by award-winning architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group. The 2,100-capacity venue has an expansive dancefloor with staggered tiers providing unobstructed views, combined with comfy stadium seating in the rear and a chic lounge area.<br />
