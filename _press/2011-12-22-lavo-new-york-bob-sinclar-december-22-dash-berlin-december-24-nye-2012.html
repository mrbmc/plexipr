<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, December 22  - Bob Sinclar</strong><br />
There are few DJs with as much international recognition and star-power as Bob Sinclar. The French producer and DJ, born Cristophe Le Friant, is well known and respected for his passion of music and his originality in flawlessly meshing differing styles. His massive club hit "Love Generation" reached the #1 spot in several countries and became the official anthem of the FIFA World Cup. Sinclar has collaborated with superstar artists like Gary Nesta Pine (formerly singer of The Wailers), Axwell, Shaggy, and Sean Paul in his never-ending quest to break down dance club barriers and traditional formats. 2011 has proven to be a pivotal year for the eclectic maestro, with released singles "Far L'Amore", and "F*** With You" from his Grammy-nominated, genre-defying remix album, ‘Made in Jamaica.’ His performance at LAVO on December 22nd is guaranteed to be a rhythm-heavy, floor-shaking dance fest, grooving strongly late into the night.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saturday, December 24 - Dash Berlin</strong><br />
Dash Berlin is more than meets the eye. With two studio mavens Eelke Kalberg and Sebastiaan Molijn, along with DJ front man Jeffrey Sutorius, they utilize their different skills in tandem, creating both big time trance tracks and killer parties. Things started with a bang in 2007 when Armin van Buuren featured "Till The Sky Falls Down" on the renowned ‘Universal Religion’ album; since then their unique futuristic brand of trance has reverberated throughout clubland with the 2009 debut artist album ‘The New Daylight,’ the 42-minute “Flashback” YouTube video mix, and their 2010 mix album ‘United Destination.’ 2011 has seen a epic collaboration with ATB "Apollo Road," and their recent release "Better Half of Me" with Jonathan Mendelsohn, along with Sutorius embarking on an epic worldwide DJ schedule, including ASOT 500 with Armin van Buuren, a residency in Ibiza, and a  special Christmas visit to LAVO New York – a miracle on 58th street, which is certainly not to be missed.</p>
