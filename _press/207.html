Pacha NYC Debut!<br />
w/ Nick Varon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents South American progressive sensation, DJ <strong>Hernan Cattaneo</strong>, for his <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> debut on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday July 4th, 2008</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Born in Buenos Aires, Hernan quickly became an icon in the fresh house music scene of his homeland. He has an unmatched understanding of house music that has landed him with the title of one of the most respected DJs in the world today. He has forged solid relationships with the likes of Sasha, John Digweed, Paul Oakenfold and Danny Tenaglia. All of which have influenced his career and ultimately led to acquiring coveted residencies at powerhouse clubs such as Clubland in Argentina and Cream in both England and Ibiza. He has played at all major festivals including Burning Man, Coachella, Creamfields and Homelands alongside the likes of The Chemical Brothers, Coldplay, Nine Inch Nails and Prodigy.</p>
<p>In May of 2006 Hernan launched his own CD series called Sequential through Renaissance Music. The series has received much praise and approval from all major dance music publications and includes tracks from producers like Marco Bailey, 16 Bit Lolitas and Paolo Mojo. More recently, Cattaneo teamed up with producer John Tonks to release their newest track titled "Anime". Out on label Urbantourque, the track delivers a groovy big room track that is right on every level with remixes by Rocco, one quarter of Rodomaal, Steve Mill and Sam Ball. It is currently on the playlists of Laurent Garnier, Tom Middleton, Satoshie Tomiie and Chris Fortier and continues to grow in popularity across the globe.</p>
<p>In addition to his amazing production works and constant global touring, Hernan Cattaneo continues to attract a global audience through his own radio show Metrodance, currently in its sixth consecutive year, which airs Saturdays from 10pm to 12am on Metro951.com (archives found on www.hernancattaneo.com).</p>
