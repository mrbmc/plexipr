<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
D. RAMIREZ<br />
w/ Sleepy &amp; Boo<br />
<em>@ Cielo</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the return of  one the UK’s finest, <strong>D. Ramirez</strong> along with <em>Basic NYC</em>’s own <strong>Sleepy &amp; Boo</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, February 25th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Many moons have passed since <strong>D. Ramirez</strong> first exploded onto the scene. Travelling the globe with his trusty laptop in hand, the always moving Ramirez has dispensed his razor sharp productions to unassuming dancefloors around the globe, all with the precision of a first class marksman.  With a career that spans the better part of a decade, Ramirez has achieved top 20 hits, performed on every continent, as well as developed the sound which single handedly coined the term “electrohouse”.  Currently, Ramirez has deviated from this trademark style and has been at work with the intricate sounds of deep house and techno. To him, this feels like a natural progression.   These are now the sounds where he finds melody and soul within the heart of the machines he loves so much.</p>
<p>D. Ramirez latest EP, ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nitr8</strong></span>’ is a complex structure of these rhythmic sounds brought together with a tight arrangement that shuffles along in true Ramirez style. Every sound is tweaked to perfection which provides listeners with a rich audio experience.  The release features two original cuts, “Nitr8” and “Devi8or”, two prime examples of the powerful, muscular sound the British producer extraordinaire has made his trademark in recent years.</p>
