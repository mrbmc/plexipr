<em>Made Event presents</em><br />
JOSH GABRIEL<br />
<em>@ Cielo </em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents the return of one of America’s favorite producers and DJ’s, <strong>Josh Gabriel</strong> at <strong>Cielo </strong>on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 15, 2009.</strong></span></p>
<p>Now an established solo artist,<strong> Josh Gabriel</strong> returns to New York City to display his talent and promote his new, freshly inspired music.  Having spent much time in the studio recently, producing Sander Kleinenberg’s new artist album, collaborating with Dave Seaman, and working on a variety of his own projects, Josh is sure to leave his mark on this night and well through the summer.  Maintaining a constant tour schedule, as well as heading a successful record label, Josh has cemented his place as one of dance music’s most important and forward thinking ambassadors.</p>
<p>His label <em>Different Pieces</em> was launched in 2008 and it integrates all aspects of an artist’s career. As both a record label and artist management group Josh, his partner Kristy Gabriel, and long-time business manager Guy Ornadel deliver a unique depth of experience by combining their individual strengths in music, artist marketing, and the related business aspects that drive and build careers. The label also provides Josh with a platform to showcase his own brand of darker, effusive musical house and techno.  His latest track “Rubber” and the Armin van Buuren supported “Josh Gabriel presents Winter Kills” project will be released on Different Pieces later this year.</p>
<p>Josh Gabriel’s reputation for amazing shows and sounds has gained him fans from all corners of the world and he continues to produce and perform at the top of his game while continuing to reach new heights. Josh rose to international fame as part of the duo <em>Gabriel&amp;Dresden</em>, winning seven industry awards for producing, songwriting and DJing - and achieving seventeen number #1 Billboard Dance Chart hits.</p>
