Pacha NYC presents<br />
EVOLVE<br />
with<br />
VICTOR CALDERONE<br />
along with special guest<br />
ADULTNAPPER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> is pleased to present the return of <strong>Victor Calderone</strong>'s scene defying party <em><strong>EVOLVE,</strong></em> joined by special guest <strong>Adultnapper</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday October 18th, 2008</strong></span> at the globally renowned and award winning club in the heart of New York City.</p>
<p>The success of the <strong>EVOLVE</strong> parties lies in Calderone's ability to blend the old with the new, the crowd favorite with the obscure, and to span genres from banging tribal to techy minimal with grace, the right amount of sexiness and loads of energy. Victor's EVOLVE residency was a staple in NYC's nightlife for the last 2 years and he now returns for one more unforgettable night with Pacha NYC 's over-the-top debauchery, spectacular sound, quality production and dazzling lighting.</p>
<p>For 20 plus years, Calderone has achieved an amazing career of successful residencies, chart-topping productions and star-studded remixes. With an early cult following and underground vibe, Victor shot to dance music stardom with massive hits like "Give It Up," "Beat Me Harder," and "Resonate."  As a producer, his natural studio talent attracted some very big attention, leading to remix work with some of pop music's most popular artists, including Depeche Mode, Goldfrapp, Beyonce, Sting and Madonna.  Calderone's music and his parties continue to push the boundaries of the genre and evolve along with his forward-thinking sound and ever-growing popularity.</p>
<p>NYC's arch tech selector <strong>Adultnapper</strong> is a shadowy figure drawn from the dark reaches of Francis Harris' imagination.  Born in Las Vegas, raised on punk rock, and schooled in philosophy, Harris went from "hating dance music," to establishing himself as a DJ/Producer with a unique sound and a global audience. His often introspective productions, which have appeared on Audiomatique, Nummer, Mule, Dirt Crew and Superfreq, defy convention; relying instead on a sophisticated, song-based approach, marked by elaborate swung micro-rhythms, thick musical baselines, complex arrangements and haunting tonal melodies. As a DJ, primarily mixing records, Harris employs precision skills and thoughtful programming to expand upon Adultnapper's sonic territory, earning him turns on the world's most discerning dancefloors; Panorama Bar, Fabric, DC10, Ibiza, The End, London, Cielo, NY, Weekend, Berlin, Pawn Shop, Miami, and Avalon, LA are just a few that he's taken on one of his trademark emotion-laden rides.</p>
<p>In 2007, Harris launched Ransom Note, a concept label which, through music, text and imagery, will tell the story of the Adultnapper character, an anti-hero who is part creative genius gone awry, part tortured dystopic philosopher, part paranoid vigilante outlaw… and part Harris himself.  Adultnapper's enigmatic Ransom Note series continues with it's third episode. This time the plot thickens as the narrative's shadowy author fades to the background, setting the stage for the prophetic return of Alexi Delano in the form of ADNY, with two revelatory new tracks. The Forms EP also sees the introduction of the story's first heroine, NYC's own Berlin transplant Camea, who rises to the challenge of remixing "Under My Skin." Out now on collectible 12" vinyl with color picture sleeve featuring drawings by John Stroud and text by Adultnapper.</p>
