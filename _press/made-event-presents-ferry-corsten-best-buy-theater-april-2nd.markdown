<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the return of Dutch dance music superstar <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong> to New York City’s Times Square for a night of sophisticated trance and house fusion at Best Buy Theater on <strong>Saturday, April 2, 2011</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Never one to rest on his accolades, Ferry is back on the road right after finishing his massive ‘Once Upon A Night’ world tour, which celebrated the second release of his hugely popular compilation series by the same name. It just goes to show that Ferry is the kind of international DJ that legends are made of. Voted into the Top 10 of DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs list for the past 5 years, he has established himself as a trailblazer of trance and continues the tradition, selling out venues worldwide with musical productions and DJ sets that combined trance, house, and electro. The facts speak for themselves: since his immersion on the scene in the late 1990s, Ferry has amassed best-selling albums, nearly a dozen gold singles, and countless awards like 'Best Producer of the Year' (Ericsson Music Awards) and 'Best Trance DJ' (Ibiza DJ Awards). He has remixed tracks in all genres of music from U2, Faithless, The Killers, Moby, Nelly Furtado, to Public Enemy and has collaborated with dance and pop artists such as Duran Duran, William Orbit, Howard Jones, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Novastar and many more. Ferry is currently nominated for an International Dance Music Award for 'Best Global DJ'. He is also preparing his new artist album, which will be released later this year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When not busy in the studio, Ferry can be found recording his weekly radio show ‘Corsten’s Countdown,’ which is available for download at <a href="http://www.ferrycorsten.com/" target="_blank">www.ferrycorsten.com</a>. Fans can also download the “Ferry Corsten app” to iPhone, Android and BlackBerry to access the real-time world of Ferry Corsten as well as interact with his online community 24 hours a day. Just make sure not to miss him in person at New York’s Best Buy Theater!</p>
