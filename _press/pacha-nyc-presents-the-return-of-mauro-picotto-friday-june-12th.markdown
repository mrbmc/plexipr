<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
The Return of<br />
MAURO PICOTTO</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC </strong></em>presents the mega-Italian DJ <strong>Mauro Picotto</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 12, 2009</strong></span> for an unforgettable night of his pulsating electronic grooves. Before he takes off for his Meganite residency in Ibiza, Picotto will showcase his techno sounds with cutting edge  electronic wizardry fused with pulsating infectious, gyrating, badass grooves.</p>
<p>The Italian techno titan launches Meganite at Privilege, Ibiza every Wednesday that houses guests such as Adam Beyer, Josh Wink, Steve Rachmad, Exercise One Live, Marco Carola, Polder Live, Anja Schneider, Paco Osuna, Technasia Live, Mark Broom, Wighnomy Brothers, Hugo, 2000andOne, Lutzenkirchen Live, Christian Smith, Paul Ritch live pumping out the best in techno, house and sultry grooves to the purist music crown, in an environment that resembles a hi-tech cave open to all genres and subgenres of the clubbing sound. Having started out as a dream in <strong>Mauro Picotto</strong>’s ever expanding mind, it wasn’t long before the over-zealous production aesthetics, surroundings and aural desires of Meganite soon became a reality for the Italian tech-trance prodigy.</p>
<p>Launched in 2004 as a mid-weekly event at Privilege, Meganite “electronic music lifestyle” gained instant kudos, becoming the talk of the white isle and all that flocked to it, packing out the dancefloors of the world’s largest nightclub every week. It was Mauro’s never-ending passion and dedication for taking inspiration from his various global adventures and experiences from different cultures, injecting all the worldly goodness onto one dancefloor that made Meganite such a resounding success, providing an innovative atmosphere for all those wanting to experience something unique.</p>
