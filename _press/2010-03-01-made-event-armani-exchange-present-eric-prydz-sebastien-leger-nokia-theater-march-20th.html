<em>Made Event &amp; Armani Exchange present</em><br />
ERIC PRYDZ &amp; SÉBASTIEN LÉGER<br />
<em>@ Nokia Theatre Times Square</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>Armani Exchange</strong></em> bring the final chapter in their series of prolific events of extraordinary sound and vision to <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 20th, 2010</strong></span>.  Two of the world’ s most in demand DJ’s and producer’s, Sweden’s <strong>Eric Prydz</strong> and France’s <strong>Sébastien Léger</strong> are set to continue this unique series of events in grand style.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Prydz</strong> unrivaled ability to combine commercial success with underground notoriety has allowed him to achieve recognition throughout the world.  The softly spoken Swede has mostly shied away from the publicity that comes with success, instead choosing to retreat to his studio and continue to produce some of electronica’s darkest and most brooding tracks. His production resume reached full steam with the Pink Floyd sampling “Proper Education, closely followed by the massive “Pjanoo”.   Prydz multiple label platforms also allow him to remain an enigma while becoming a household name. On <em>Pryda</em>, he explores his house influences with a plethora of tracks like “Aftermath”, “Armed”, and “Melo”.  <em>Mouseville</em> sees Prydz releasing a harder and more upfront techno sound, as felt on the EP “On/Off”.  Prydz has also launched <em>Pryda Friends</em> as an outlet for tracks from his peers like Paolo Mojo and Axwell.  Since his arrival, Prydz has inadvertently broken into uncharted territories of dance music. Massive venues and top clubs around the world have rocked to his performances and productions, safe in the knowledge that they’re witnessing a one of a kind talent at work.</p>
<p><strong>Sébastien Léger</strong> begins a new decade at the peak of his powers with his label <em>Mistakes</em> continuing to cement his role as one of Europe’s leading purveyors of the modern techno sound.  Léger began producing music at the end of the 1990’s, and though surrounded by the sounds of French filter house, he looked to the U.S. for his primary inspiration.   The antithesis of some of his French contemporaries, Léger draws his influence from the rich musical histories of Detroit and Chicago.  Despite this classic techno influence, Léger’s music is decidedly 21st century.  Tracks such as “Binola”, “The White Island”, and “The Rhythm”, lie at the funkier end of the techno spectrum while holding true to their roots.  With Over 50 EPS on labels like<em> Ovum</em>, <em>Intec</em>, and <em>Pryda</em>, Léger’s discography could be the envy of most.  His latest remix of Cirez D’s “On/Off” continues to show Léger pushing the boundaries of production and adapting to the sounds of technology as it evolves. Despite his more cerebral sound of late, he continues to bring dancefloor’s a funky sensibility, injecting his music with the very heart and soul that he feels while in the studio.  With such a prolific studio and DJ schedule, Léger as firmly planted himself at the forefront of modern dance music, taking his sounds to wherever dance culture shines brightest.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> is an indoor theater designed by award-winning architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group. The 2,100-capacity venue has an expansive dancefloor with staggered tiers providing unobstructed views, combined with comfy stadium seating in the rear and a chic lounge area.</p>
