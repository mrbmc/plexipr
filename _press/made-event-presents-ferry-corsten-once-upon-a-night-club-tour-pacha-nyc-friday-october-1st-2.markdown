<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the return of Dutch dance music pioneer <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong> to <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> for an official stop on the 'Once Upon A Night' club tour on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October 1st, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Trance superstar Ferry Corsten is the kind of international DJ that legends are made of. Voted into the Top 10 of DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs list for the past 5 years, he has established himself as a trailblazer of trance and continues the tradition, selling out venues worldwide with musical productions and DJ sets that combined trance, house, and electro. The facts speak for themselves: since his immersion on the scene in the late 1990s, Ferry has amassed best-selling albums, nearly a dozen gold singles, and countless awards like Best Producer of the Year (Ericsson Music Awards) and Best Trance DJ (Ibiza DJ Awards). Tracks like “Carte Blanche,” “Cry” and “Punk,” and remixes for Markus Schulz, Moby, U2 and more have been played by the most elite DJs in the hottest clubs around the world.</p>
<p>But as fans already know, Corsten has never been one to rest on his accolades. In October, Ferry is set to release <strong>Once Upon A Night, Vol. 2</strong>. the much anticipated 2-disc, 26-track follow up to his highly acclaimed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once Upon A Night</span> mix compilation. To support the release, Ferry will be visiting over 20 cities on his North American Tour, including New York’s legendary club Pacha NYC, where he’ll be sure to take the sophisticated fusion trance and house as well as banging elements of “Once Upon A Night” to the extremes.</p>
<p>In addition, AM Only is proud to partner with Ferry, Made Event, and Pacha NYC to bring you an exclusive Meet &amp; Greet contest from the first of six tour stops Ferry has hand-picked himself. One lucky fan and their guest will not only win a pair of tickets but also a Meet &amp; Greet with Ferry Corsten prior to the Pacha NYC show as well as a copy of the album and a Ferry Corsten T-shirt. This contest is open to anyone who would like to join. Winners for the New York City show at Pacha NYC on October 1st will be selected at random and be notified via email on September 28, 2010. <a href="http://meetferrycorsten.amonly.com/">Enter the contest now</a>!</p>
<p><em>“Once Upon A Night, Vol.2” will be released October 22nd in the USA.</em></p>
