<p><b>Made at Pacha</b> presents a powerful combo of two of the most respected artists in dance music today - NYC house music legend <b>Danny Tenaglia</b> and techno maestro <b>Richie Hawtin</b> join forces for a legendary night of electronic dance music.  At first, this unique pairing may seem at odds to their traditional fans, but their mutual love of techno and clubbing make them ideal partners for an awesome night of clubbing where techno is the answer.</p>
