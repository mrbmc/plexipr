Parade down Broadway to Tompkins Square Park<br />
Dance festival finale in the park</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, May 17th, 2008 thousands will be dancing in the streets of New York City to mark the second annual Dance Parade. The parade encompasses virtually all forms of dance, bringing together 29 genres of dance, loads of dancers, live bands, colorful floats and talented DJs. This year, one float that will definitely stand out will be that of New York City's biggest nightclub, Pacha NYC. Designed and decorated by the same talented crew that prepares the mega club for all of its grand events, the float will surely be one to remember. Adorned by the signature Pacha cherries and talented, costumed dancers, the float will be helmed by Bronx teenage phenoms The Martinez Brothers, who are bound to bring the same high energy they express in their DJ shows to the streets of New York City. Then afterwards, join Victor Calderone for his EVOLVE residency with special guests The Martinez Brothers at Pacha NYC for dancing into the night.Dance Parade was established to celebrate the art form of dance, which in most cases takes place in many of the nightclubs in NYC. Of all the entries into the parade, however, the only nightclub to participate is in fact Pacha. Since its opening in 2005, Pacha NYC has become an international clubbing destination, as well as winning the "Best Superclub" title at the Club World Awards in 2007 &amp; 2008. Each and every night at Pacha exhibits a new experience coupled with elegance and professionalism synonymous with the worldwide cosmopolitan clubbing brand.</p>
<p>The Martinez Brothers were born and raised in New York City and in a few short years Chris and Steve Martinez jumped into the dance music and have taken it over by storm with recent shows at Pacha NYC and Cielo. Originally discovered by renowned DJ and producer, Dennis Ferrer, the two find a way to mix classics with today's music in a way few have succeeded at. The brothers bring a level of energy that is synonymous to New York and akin to their soulful roots.</p>
<p>Dance Parade seeks to honor Dance's historical roots in the city as well as unite in respecting Dance's diversity. Last year marked the start of a tradition heralded by many in the streets of New York City. The art of dance now has a large stage to celebrate all its forms in front of the world. This year's parade will exhibit nearly 5,000 dancers in over 50 different styles of dance. Everything from house to hip-hop, ballet to belly dance, B-boy to the rumba, and from salsa to swing, will all converge down Broadway together. It will surely be a delight to all in attendance and participation, as we legitimize Dance as a communicative, social form of expression. Come support the music and dance that drives you...Come Dance with us on May 17th, 2008!</p>
