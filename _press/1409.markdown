<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
MARK KNIGHT<br />
<em>NO PANTS PARTY</em></strong></p>
<p>After a blistering performance for the first night of his <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> residency, <strong>Mark Knight</strong> returns on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, April 24th, 2009</strong></span> for the first NO PANTS PARTY, with his trousers checked at the door. Inspired by the New York improv troup <em>Improv Everywhere</em>’s <em><strong>NO PANTS! SUBWAY RIDE</strong></em>, Pacha NYC is kicking off the worldwide <em><strong>NO PANTS DAY 2009</strong></em> (May 1st – <a href="http://">www.wehatepants.com</a>). Pacha NYC will be taking their pants OFF to put the FUN back into clubbing. Mark’s vision and approach to his residency and his DJ sets, have an underlying desire to inject the fun band absurd back into clubbing. What better way to do that than with NO PANTS?!? Clubbers can expect this sort of antics all year long, kicking off in February with a dancefloor full of Groucho mustache sporting club heads. No telling what sort of surprises to expect with a Mark Knight DJ set, now more improved with NO PANTS!!!</p>
<p><em><strong>Check your pants at the door for complimentary admission!</strong></em></p>
<p>Mark Knight has forged himself a reputation as one of the foremost house producers on the planet, shaping the scene with his Toolroom imprint. A string of consistently hot productions and skillfully written remixes, from Kylie through to Underworld, have secured ongoing success at the top of the dance charts. Production highlights of late 2008 would have to be Mark’s incredible remake of Laurent Garnier’s ‘Man With The Red Face’, officially Beatport’s fastest ever selling record. Never one to rest on his laurels Mark launched “Toolroom Knights” as a signature club night at the Amsterdam Dance Event and since then has gone on to host parties at key cities across the world with established residencies at Ministry of Sound (London), Redlight (Paris), Cocoon (Frankfurt), Sankey’s (Manchester). The “Toolroom Knights”, based around the label, and Mark’s distinctive sound introduced the underground sound of Toolroom to the clubbing masses with a superb DJ line up reflective of the label. In 2009, Toolroom Knights continue their conquest with North American residencies at Pacha NYC and Avalon (Los Angeles).</p>
