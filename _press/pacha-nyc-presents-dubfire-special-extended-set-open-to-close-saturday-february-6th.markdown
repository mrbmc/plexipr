<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
DUBFIRE</strong><br />
[Special extended set: open to close]</p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents a special extended performance from four-time nominated, Grammy Award-winning artist,  the prolific techno DJ and producer <strong>DUBFIRE</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, February 6th, 2010</strong></span>. As the musical mastermind of the entire night, Dubfire will be at the helm of the music from the beginning to the very end.</p>
<p>Few artists can boast the kind of critical and commercial success Ali ‘<strong>Dubfire</strong>’ Shirazinia has managed to achieve. Dubfire has proved his versatility not only as a world-respected powerhouse artist, but also a sought-after remixer and all around risk-taker. He has collaborated with some of the biggest names and released an array of notable remixes, productions, acclaimed artist albums, and mix CD’s landing him at the top of multiple "best of" charts, all the while unknowingly setting a merciless musical standard difficult for others to follow.</p>
<p>After 15 ground-breaking years topping charts as one-half of Deep Dish, Dubfire’s solo creative journey to explore musical boundaries has since garnered world-wide appeal as fans and critics alike embraced his new unexpected, deep and evocative sound. Shaped by his love for a wide range of musical influences and his insistence on pushing the envelope musically, Dubfire’s less mainstream, darker sound proves he can conquer both dance music’s commercial and underground. 2009 was a momentous year for Dubfire . His production partnership with techno maestro Oliver Huntemann brought the electronic dance scene to its knees with the release of three massive dance floor hits: "Diablo", "Dios”, and most recently "Fuego". He won his third Beatport Award as "Best Techno Artist", 8 of his production/remixes are listed on Beatport’s "Best of DJ Charts, 2009" with "Split the Line" remaining as one of Beatport's top sellers, and his latest single "Rabid" is on the “Beatport Top 10” list.</p>
<p>2010 will mark yet another banner year as Dubfire’s momentum powers on. Amidst his busy touring schedule, he continues to nurture fresh talent worldwide with his own label, <em><strong>Science + Technology Digital Audio</strong></em>, and his collaboration with Oliver Huntemann has a host of exciting productions lined up to be released this year. Dubfire has earned the reputation as one of  the most forward-thinking artists and he continues to prove himself as a dance floor heavyweight while exploring new sounds and staying true to his “punk ethic”. Renowned for his flawless mixing and ability to tease the crowd with minimal goodness, don’t miss this special extended set from one of America's dance music's icons.</p>
