ETE D’AMOURAt Santos Party House<br />
100 Lafayette St, NYC<br />
ÂME (Frank Wiedermann)<br />
BOOMBASS (from Cassius)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ete D’Amour</strong> is counting down to its last four weeks of the summer of love!  On <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, September 11th</strong></span>, we bring together two-halves to create a greater whole. <strong>Frank Wiederman</strong>, one-half of Âme, the soulful, deep house duo from Berlin joins Parisian hip-hop evangelist <strong>Boombass</strong>, one-half of Cassius at <strong>Santos Party House</strong>.</p>
<p>Âme are German duo Kristian Beyer &amp; Frank Wiedemann. Inspired by the music of Stevie Wonder, West End Rec, Transmat, Weather Report and Herbie Hancock, they make Detroit-influenced deep house and music with soul. Now Âme is gearing up to launch Fabric 42, the vaulted club-mix series this Fall 2008.  On the highly anticipated compilation, Âme create a kaleidoscopic blend of electronics and infectious grooves. They have created their own soundscape here with an all-star cast, which breathes a magical soundtrack to the last days of summer and beyond.</p>
<p>Hubert Blanc-Francart, better known as Boombass, is one half of the highly acclaimed duo Cassius (with Philippe Zdar), who have occupied the upper echelons of French electronica since1999.  Hubert has been a tireless evangelist of hip hop, producing MC Solaar's milestone album, Qui Seme Le Vent Recolte Le Tempo in the early Nineties, which was the first peak in a wave of dance music ­ hip-hop, house, drum &amp; bass, reggae and techno that now dominates the French charts. The legendary Parisian electro-house duo Cassius have since released their third studio album 15 Again in 2006 featuring the international dancefloor smash "Toop Toop", the soulful "Rock Number One" and the Pharrell Williams collaboration "Eye Water".</p>
<p>The one and only Respect party is back in New York with its club festival ÉTÉ D'AMOUR, to celebrate the summer! A long overdue comeback to the NYC nightlife landscape, Respect unites with Le Jean De and first-class promoters Made Event for a sizzling summer series destined to reclaim downtown nightlife for NYC’s own ÉTÉ D’AMOUR. Expect a twist of legendary DJs, fresh sounds, new sensations, incessant flirting, and lots of romance.</p>
