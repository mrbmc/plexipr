<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1368 aligncenter" title="djsteveporter.com" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/porter.jpg" alt="djsteveporter.com" width="300" height="300" /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Steve Porter Releases The Control EP</strong><strong><br />
In Advance of New LP This Spring</strong></p>
<p>As a DJ and Producer, <strong>Steve Porter</strong> is at the top of his game. With a non-stop international touring schedule, prolific productions and inimitable DJ style, Porter is setting the bar high for the next generation of electronic dance music artists. His latest, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Control EP</strong></span> is the prelude to his upcoming, second full length artist album due out in late Spring 2009.</p>
<p>This Winter Music Conference, Porter will join the BACARDI® B-LIVE™ press launch event, along with innovative artists A-Trak, Dilpo, and MSTRKRFT to be held at the Fontainebleau Resort on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thursday, March 26th</span> in Miami. On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, March 27th</span>, Porter will join his AM Only agency's annual showcase with today's biggest dance music stars with a special tag-team set with Funkagenda at Karu &amp; Y. To culminate the conference week, Porter will helm his annual PH recordings showcase at B.E.D. Miami on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Saturday, March 28th</span>. He will be joined by his roster of label artists and special guest <strong>DJ Dan,</strong> one of the pioneers of the west coast house explosion throughout the 90s to the present day wave of electro and indie dance. Today, DJ Dan continues to push the envelope as he brings his exclusive cuts to the PH party from his debut artist album entitled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future Retro</span>.</p>
<p>Steve Porter's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Control EP</span> is a collection of surefire club hits as eclectic in style as a typical night behind the decks.  Staying true to his philosophy and demonstrating his versatility <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Control EP</span> seamlessly mixes several genres while maintaining the dance floor edge that drives the dancefloor into a frenzy. In addition to its peak time title track, the EP also contains the house/breakbeat mash up “Don’t Be Afrayed”, the electro influenced “Fake It”, as well as the appropriately titled “Rizer”.</p>
<p>Steve Porter stands among the most talented of the next generation of electronic dance music artists. Over his career, Porter has showcased his prolific DJ style encompassing a genre defying mix of funked up house beats and techy jams mixed together with an arsenal of re-edits and mixes, which propelled him into the international arena and landed him on DJ Times’ list of “<em>America’s Best DJs</em>.” His own label PH Recordings focuses on introducing new artists from his own collective of Boston artists, other emerging global acts and as an outlet for his own prolific, cutting edge productions. Outside of the DJ booth, Porter has just signed on to produce two more original tracks for Konami’s next DanceDanceRevolution game and is also shooting a pilot episode for the Travel Channel where he’ll be serving as host to introduce global dance culture around the world. Steve Porter can also be heard on his weekly <em>Porterhouse</em> show on Sirius XM Satellite radio’s Area channel.</p>
<p><em>The Control EP is out now exclusively at Beatport on PH Recordings.</em></p>
