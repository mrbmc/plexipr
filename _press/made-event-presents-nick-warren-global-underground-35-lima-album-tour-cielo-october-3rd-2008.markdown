NICK WARREN<br />
'Global Underground 35 Lima' Album Tour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents Global Underground's eminent DJ <strong>Nick Warren</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October 3rd, 2008</strong></span> in support of his new GU city series 35th installment, <em>GU35 Nick Warren Lima</em>.</p>
<p>Selling over 110,000 Global Underground albums in the UK alone over his 11 year history with the brand, <strong>Nick Warren</strong>'s name is synonymous with underground musical integrity and commercial success.  Selecting the Peruvian capital Lima for his latest release in the legendary GU city series, Warren compiles an entirely exclusive track list to capture the sound and ambience of this historic former Incan city.  Based around the Global Underground event captured in the album's beautiful stylized artwork, the GU Lima mix is a sonic missile – simple, direct, and deadly.  There is a definite cosmopolitan futurism about it akin with the city itself.</p>
<p>As one-half of Way Out West, Nick Warren along with Jody Wisternoff exploded on the scene with "The Gift" in 1997. After three critically acclaimed albums 'Way out West', 'Intensify' and 'Don't Look Now', the masters of all that is atmospheric, grand and dramatic are back with a new album, set to drop in 2009 on Hope Recordings. The first single from the forthcoming album, "Spaceman" follows the boys' classic anthemic, main room sound, and is a stunning masterpiece replete with heavy, nasty sub-bass, wonderful percussion and a classic beautiful piano break. The "Spaceman" package includes an elegant remix by Robert Babicz and to round it out, Terracotta Army have taken elements from a couple of Way Out West's finest moments and remixed them to perfection.</p>
