GARETH EMERY<br />
<em>with Zack Roth</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> presents one of trance’s fastest rising stars, <strong>Gareth Emery</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 12th, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Whether it was his critically acclaimed debut on the<em> BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix</em>, or his rise to number 23 in the definitive <em>DJ Mag Top 100</em> Poll, there wasn’t much that hasn’t gone right for <strong>Gareth Emery</strong> so far, following a year that saw him become increasingly established as one of the most innovative, unique, and exciting figures in dance music. With numerous world-class productions, explosive DJ sets across the globe, and one of the scene’s most downloaded podcasts, you wild think he’s a long-established dance music veteran. But at 28, he’s just getting started.</p>
<p>Boasting a relentless touring schedule that sees him demolishing dancefloors at the some of the finest clubs like Home, Zouk, The Guverment, and Amnesia or festivals like Holland’s Trance Energy or Belgium’s Tomorrowland, the world has quickly become witness to Gareth’s signature style of languid, spacey grooves, juddering basslines, killer melodies, and hooks. It is no wonder he has garnered acclaim from a who’s who of trance’s biggest names.  A list that includes Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Judge Jules, Ferry Corsten, and Paul van Dyk.</p>
<p>Gareth was one of the first DJs to embrace the current craze of podcasting when he launched <em>The Gareth Emery Podcast </em>in 2006. The antithesis of long drawn-out DJ mixes, the show soon became the essential download for savvy dance music fans, with each episode providing an expose of the best that the world of trance, house, and progressive has to offer. Its success hasn’t gone unnoticed by the industry either, being nominated for ‘<em>Best Podcast</em>’ at the IDMA Awards every year since the category was introduced.</p>
<p>His 2009 plans encompass a staggering amount of new projects, including his debut artist album and <em>Garuda</em>, his new record label and events brand he’s launching after previously heading the much-missed Five AM imprint.</p>
