<p><strong>Marquee Nightclub &amp; Dayclub</strong> is proud to announce the return of <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong>, <strong>ATB</strong>, <strong>Benny Benassi</strong>,<strong>Chuckie</strong>, <strong>Dirty South</strong>, <strong>Erick Morillo</strong>, <strong>Kaskade, Markus Schulz</strong> and <strong>Redfoo</strong> for exclusive residencies in 2012. In just the last year, Marquee has established itself as the number one destination for the world’s premier electronic music talent, putting Las Vegas on the map as the “<em>New Ibiza,</em>” according to <em>MTV News</em>. Marquee continues to take clubbing to the next level with its larger-than-life 40-foot LED DJ booth, dazzling custom visuals, state-of-the-art sound system with 32,000-watt subwoofers, and beautifully costumed dancers. To top it off, 2012 sees all new, custom visual programming. The initial line-up of residents is just a hint of what is in store and club goers can expect more exciting announcements and additional headliners throughout Marquee’s second year.</p>
<p>In alphabetical order:<strong> </strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong>, UK’s most popular DJ/producer collective, return to Marquee on January 21 as part of their North American tour supporting their critically acclaimed second artist album ‘Group Therapy,’ which features Billboard dance chart hits like "Sun &amp; Moon" and "Thing Called Love," and was named “the biggest artist album of the year” by <em>Mixmag</em>.  <em>“We can't wait to return in 2012 for our residency at Marquee Las Vegas.  It's one of our favourite clubs in the world to play and we always have an incredible time.”</em> [Tony McGuinness, Above and Beyond]<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>ATB</strong>’s latest album ‘Distant Earth’ featured the likes of Armin van Buuren and Dash Berlin. Well known for his single “9PM (Till I Come)” and also his eight studio albums, six ‘in the mix’ compilations, his ‘Sunset Beach DJ Session’ compilation and a total of four DVDs, he has established himself as one of the decade’s most important international electronic music artists. <strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Benny Benassi</strong>, who won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Dance Remix, continues to dominate the electronic music world with his 2011 album ‘Electroman,’ which features the hits “Spaceship” with Kelis, “Beautiful People” with Chris Brown and “Cinema” (feat Gary Go), remixed by Skrillex. He kicks off his Marquee residency on February 18.<strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chuckie,</strong> the King of Dirty Dutch, brings Amsterdam’s daring, sophisticated and sexy style back to Marquee for another year starting January 13. Named one of “The Dance Music Producers of the Moment” by <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Chuckie recently released the ‘Dirty Dutch Blackout’ compilation featuring his new hit “What Happens in Vegas.”<strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dirty South</strong>, who has earned “Essential New Tune” labels by Pete Tong and Grammy Award nominations in Best Remix for Kaskade’s “Sorry” and The Temper Trap’s “Sweet Disposition” (with Axwell), brings his signature dark house sound back to Marquee on January 6.<strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Erick Morillo</strong>’s Subliminal Sessions residency inaugurated the dancefloor at Marquee one year ago and has brought a packed house ever since. He recently launched a new project, SYMPHO NYMPHO, with house production legends Harry ‘Choo Choo’ Romero and Jose Nunez. Their album drops in March 2012, featuring guest performances from Wyclef Jean, Pitbull, Busta Rhymes, Dizzee Rascal and more. <strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaskade</strong> was recently voted <em>“America’s Best DJ”</em> in <em>DJ Times</em>, finishing a year that also saw a legendary BBC Essential Mix and the release of his seventh studio album, the double CD ‘Fire &amp; Ice,’ featuring Skrillex, Dada Life, Skylar Grey and more. His 2012 residency kicks off on January 14.<strong> </strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Markus Schulz</strong> returns to his Marquee residency after a consistently wowing the crowd with his fusion of progressive, house and trance into an inimitable hybrid sound last year. Summer saw this DJ Mag Top 10 DJ release 'Thoughts Become Things II' under his alter-ego Dakota, which explores a darker, most devoutly club sound. While the original earned an Album of the Month award from Mixmag, Markus recently followed up with 'Thoughts Become Things II: The Remixes' with reworks from Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano and more.</p>
<p><strong>Redfoo</strong>’s raucous, no-holds barred Party Rock Mondays residency returns for 2012.  Redfoo, one of dance music's preeminent talents and son of Motown legend Berry Gordy, has taken the electronic dance music scene by storm, both through his solo DJ gigs and as part of the prolific LMFAO. Redfoo has established himself as a one of the globe’s preeminent party DJs, while LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It" hit #1 on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs, Top 10 for Billboard Dance Club Songs and iTunes Top 10 Songs charts.</p>
