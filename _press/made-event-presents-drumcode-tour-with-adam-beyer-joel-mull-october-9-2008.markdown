<strong>Drumcode Tour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the Drumcode Tour featuring a double-header of Swedish techno masters, <strong>Adam Beyer</strong> and special guest <strong>Joel Mull</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, October 9th, 2008</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Beyer</strong> has become synonymous with the techno sound of Sweden, which has quite literally shaken the world since the mid-nineties. His prolific Drumcode label continues its adventures into techno as they approach their 50th landmark release. Recent 12" recordings include techno hammers from Marco Bailey &amp; Tom Hades (DC44), Dustin Zahn (DC45), The Advent Vs Industrialyzer (DC45, 46.5) and upcoming release by Tony Rohr (DC47). From the driving percussive force of his Drumcode label to the more open electronic miasma on his current Truesoul and Mad Eye imprints, Beyer remains one of the biggest and most influential producer/DJs on the planet. Ever keen to continually evolve and develop, his three studio albums 'Decoded' (Planet Rhythm, 1996), 'Protection' (Drumcode, 1999) and 'Ignition Key' (Truesoul, 2002) aptly show the Swedes studio development from raw diamond to the polished article.  With such a melting pot of electronic styles, Beyer has more recently set up a new imprint for a more stripped down and minimal sound, Mad Eye.  The label heralds a new subtle, more production focused slant inspired largely by Beyer's experiences in Ibiza over the past several years.</p>
<p><strong>Joel Mull </strong>started traveling around the globe more than a decade ago and quickly made himself well known as the "Swedish Techno Soul" of the electronic world.  Both Mull and Beyer are long time friends, colleagues, and collaborators.  Additionally, Mull has had a residency spot on the "Drumcode" label parties that Adam has been taking on the road over the past six years.  In 2007 Joel Mull had a string of releases and collaborations with artists such as Sean Palm, Xpansul and Vincenzo, Audiomatique, and Discos De Lata.  However, his most important release to date is his highly regarded artist album 'The Observer' (Harthouse, 2007).  Recently, Joel Mull returned to Saved Records, the highly respected and admired independent label of Nic Fanciulli and Andy Chatterley, and has created the 'Face Up' EP which has already garnered support from the likes of Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier and Christian Smith, to name a few.</p>
