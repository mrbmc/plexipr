<p>New York City’s renowned nightclub<strong> Cielo</strong> brings a lineup of its residents and favorites to downtown Miami for Conference 2010 at <strong>The Vagabond </strong>on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wednesday, March 24th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Multiple award winning venue and New York clubbing institution <strong>Cielo</strong> returns to the sunny shores of Miami, and brings an impressive lineup of world class headliners, as well as its favorite resident DJ’s.  Known throughout the clubbing world as one of the finest clubs for top notch electronic dance music, the Cielo brand has become synonymous with quality music, design, and sound.  This year the prestigious <em><strong>Club World Awards</strong></em> have, once again, nominated Cielo in multiple categories including <em>Best Club</em>, <em>Best Party</em> (Dance.Here.Now.), and<em> Best Resident DJ</em> (Francois K, for his long-running Deep Space Monday nights).  And on the global stage, the <em><strong>International Dance Music Awards</strong></em> have nominated Cielo for <em>Best U.S. Club</em> and <em>Best Soundsystem</em> (Funktion One).</p>
<p>Cielo will take over downtown Miami hot spot <strong>The Vagabond</strong> for one night with three separate areas of music to display distinctive musical styles throughout the night to whet every appetite. The main room’s deep house, tech-house grooves will move the body. The side room will showcase nu-disco, leftfield dance tunes and finally, the outdoor garden will host a mix of chill out and funky grooves. The eclectic line up begins with international sensation and <em>Innervisions</em> recording artist <strong>Alex from Tokyo</strong>.  House music maestro <strong>Behrouz</strong> is as much a favorite on a New York dancefloor as he is in his adopted hometown of Miami.  <em>Adult Section</em>’s <strong>Darshan Jesrani</strong> and <strong>Dennis Kane</strong> bring their eclectic disco grooves from their popular Cielo residency.  Ibiza mainstay <strong>DJ Pippi</strong> has been mixing records since the seventies and has held some of the most prestigious residencies on the white isle.  <strong>Jojo Flores</strong> is a global ambassador of soulful house and eclectic DJ sets from his <em>Therapy</em> nights and his own <em>GotSoul Records</em> imprint. <em>Cadenza</em> favorite <strong>Michel Cleis</strong>’ productions are consistently heard on dancefloors around the world including last year’s WMC anthem “La Mezcla.”  Nickodemus has provided New York with his legendary Tuntables on the Hudson events for over a decade now.  Cielo resident &amp; co-owner <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> combines elements of deep house and tech-house with soulful and disco influences regularly on his Paradizo residency nights.  <em>Circoloco</em> favorite <strong>Tania Vulcano</strong>’s style of deep, percussive lead house music has made her a favorite of the world’s top venues.  <strong>Tedd Patterson</strong> is well revered amongst house music circles as one of the greats.  His <em>Vibal</em> nights bring a virtual who’s who of house legends to the legendary Cielo booth.  Cielo brings a special live performance from Spaniards <strong>Wagon Cookin</strong> with their fusion of jazz, soul, latin, brazil, funk and house.  Finally, Pacha Ibiza &amp; Cielo resident <strong>Willie Graff</strong> brings his deep, soulful grooves and percussive Afro–Latin rhythms to round out the musical arsenal on this special night, when Cielo takes over Miami!</p>
