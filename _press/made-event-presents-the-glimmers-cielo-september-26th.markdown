Made Event presents<br />
THE GLIMMERS</strong></p>
<p><em>Free debut album Gee Gee Fazzi to the first 300 people through the door!</em></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents Belgian disco dons <strong>The Glimmers</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, September 26th, 2008</strong></span>. The first 300 people to arrive will receive a free copy of their debut artist album <em>'Gee Gee Fazzi'</em> â€“ not available in stores!</p>
<p><strong>The Glimmers </strong>(Mo Becha and David Fouquaert) produce sublime dance mixes that have become revelations for the modern clubbing era. With a series of international highly acclaimed mix albums for DJ Kicks, Eskimo, and the highly-touted FabricLive series, they've also remixed Bloc Party, The Killers, New Order, Roxy Music, Isolee, Phoenix, Pop Del Arte, Snow Patrol, Calvin Harris, Shocking Pinks, Mylo, Shirley Bassey and The Chemical Brother, as well as creating dozens of original tracks reflecting their taste for a deep, metronomic, groove-laden experience, known as Belgian New Beat. Their parties are laden with an amalgamation of new beat, funk, dub, house, techno, party hip hop, new wave and edgy post-punk disco, basically anything made-to-order for the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Now, The Glimmers finally have their debut album Gee Gee Fazzi ready for the masses. Flaunting record label conventions the duo are taking control and distributing the album for free at their club dates. Titled Gee Gee Fazzi after a track by ex-Yello member Carlos Peron, the album promises to be as eclectic as The Glimmers record collection with collaborations with Princess Superstar, Freeform Five, Lindstrom &amp; Prins Thomas, Optimo Espacio, Kenneth Bager, Ray Mang, Foxylane, Baby G, CJ Bolland and many more.
