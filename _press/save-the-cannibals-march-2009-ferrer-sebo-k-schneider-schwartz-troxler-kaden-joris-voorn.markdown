March  28  Joris Voorn Balance 014 CD Release Party with illich Mujica </strong></p>
<p>March may still be cold in New York, but the dance floor at <strong>Rebel</strong> is piping hot with the freshest underground techno the world has to offer. <strong>Made Event</strong> brings you another four weeks with some of the most respected names in the genre, all powered by the newly installed and engineered <strong>Integral Sound</strong> system. We swear it’s sounding better by the week! With a first time New York appearance from Mathias Kaden and Balance release party with Joris Voorn, clubbers will not have to go far to <strong>Save the Cannibals</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>MARCH 7 – DENNIS FERRER &amp; SEBO K with ANTHONY PARASOLE</strong><br />
Right place, right time may be the best way to sum up <strong>Dennis Ferrer</strong> in so many words. Always seeming to be on the forefront of current musical trends, Dennis is no stranger to crafting his sound to continually be regarded as one of the top producers in the industry. Dennis’ new imprint, <em>Objektivity</em>, has seen great success from some unlikely places and some from right around the block, giving an American take on the deep house revival sweeping Europe at the moment. The latest release teams up Ferrer’s protégés, The Martinez Brothers with Berlin’s Argy on “Debbie Downer” for a cross-continental dancefloor deep-tech vibe. No stranger to that revival is <strong>Sebo K</strong>, a long time key figure in Berlin’s electronic dance music community. With current deep house anthem “Diva”, Sebo’s music can be heard in many different DJ’s sets all over the globe. The American and German sound come together to create a special Objektivity night on New York’s hottest new sound system. After a solid opening set for Cassy, New York’s own son  <strong>Anthony Parasole</strong> will be back once again to set the night off just right.</p>

<p><strong>MARCH 14  - GUIDO SCHNEIDER &amp; DAMIAN SCHWARTZ with PLEXUS</strong><br />
Madrid based DJ and producer, <strong>Damian Schwartz</strong> comes to New York packed with an arsenal of his own personal feelings and concepts in modern electronic music, described as raw sequences, daily samples, strong patters, frantic rhythms and some innovation born in the streets of Spain. His own output can be heard on his own <em>Mupa</em> label and as a <em>CMYK</em> recording artist. Also no stranger to being locked in the studio, <strong>Guido Schneider</strong> from Poker Flat recordings fame has seen huge success with a string of massive releases and some choice remixes on Taksi and Minus. Joining the crew will be other Minus cohort Plexus, a local favorite around the New York minimal scene</p>

<p><strong>MARCH 21 – SETH TROXLER &amp; MATHIAS KADEN</strong><br />
Everyone’s favorite Berlin/Detroit transplant <strong>Seth Troxler</strong> will be making his Cannibals residency debut undoubtedly proving why Resident Advisor had chosen him as an <em>artist to watch</em> in 2009. Having smash hits on leading labels like Wagon Repair and Crosstown Rebels, this rising techno star is definitely drawing international attention and recognition. Germany’s<strong> Mathias Kaden</strong> has also been raising eyebrows over here in the U.S. after a rousing performance at DEMF. This Freude Am Tanzen &amp; Vakant label mainstay’s unique repertoire includes funky and freaky rhythms enriched by African and South American percussions. This will be his exciting NYC debut! No need for an opener on this night, just the dynamic duo - Seth and Mathias. So come early and stay late until the lights come on.</p>

<p><strong>MARCH 28 – JORIS VOORN BALANCE 014 CD RELEASE PARTY with illich Mujica </strong><br />
Dutch DJ/Producer <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> is hotly tipped as the next big thing, on the eve of the release of his magnificent <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 014</span> compilation. Across two discs and using – remarkably – over 100 tracks, Joris constructs a complex, layered and seamless mix of some of the best tech house, minimal and electronic dance music. An epic mix in the very best sense of the word, Joris achieves the rare feat of combining variety and consistency, both on the album and on dancefloors alike. Joris will only be appearing on this U.S. tour at <em>Save the Cannibals</em> and the infamous <em>Sunday School for Degenerates</em> in Miami the following day, so get a spot front row on the dancefloor with Made Event. <strong>illich Mujica</strong> will be starting things off with his own unique blend of eclectic and dynamic dance floor material.</p>
<p><em>Joris Voorn <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 014</span> is out April 7th on EQ Recordings</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>Essentially following the Richie Hawtin blueprint of mixing many tracks at once into entirely new morasses of beautiful noise, over the course of two CDs, Voorn melts lush tech-house, minimal techno, deep electronica, folk and much more into a perfectly judged voyage across widescreen vistas, quite stunning in their escape.  This is truly DJing 2.0 - Joris Voorn belongs in the pantheon of dancefloor titans for this instant classic</em>." - <strong>DJ MAG (5/5)</strong></p>
