<em>Pacha NYC presents</em><br />
A Special Double-Birthday Event<br />
DANNY TENAGLIA<br />
All Night<br />
VICTOR CALDERONE<br />
All Day</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents two legendary NYC DJs in a once-in-a-life-time pairing – <strong>DANNY TENAGLIA</strong> and <strong>VICTOR CALDERONE</strong>, both celebrating their birthdays for a marathon session on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, March 7th, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For one night only, lightning will strike twice in the Pacha NYC DJ booth, where two of Brooklyn’s finest sons will put their DJ skills to the test for a meeting of the musical minds and melding of beats on the dancefloor. Known for his legendary marathon birthday sets, <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong> will be gearing up for Winter Music Conference and previewing an assortment of new releases and special original edits for the most discriminating audience in New York City.  Expect forward thinking music from the industry’s “DJ’s DJ”, as this preview is always a pre-Miami must to find out what’s been hotly tipped as the next big hit. This past summer, his “Futurism” album release party at Pacha NYC resulted in a nomination for “Best DJ Set” at the Club World Awards. Be sure not to miss out on yet another legendary set!</p>
<p><strong>Victor Calderone</strong> may be best known for his tribal sounds, but his music delves into everything from house to techno to garage, while still keeping to a very focused program. Also celebrating his birthday, expect Victor to dig deep into his vast collection for some choice cuts ranging from the early days, to unreleased sonic gems. Now nominated as Club World Awards “Best Resident DJ” for Pacha NYC, and with a new artist album on the way, Victor is set to ignite into 2009.</p>
