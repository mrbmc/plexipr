<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, July 7 - Dada Life</strong><br />
With their ubiquitous remix of Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” playing in the hottest clubs across the world, the Swedish duo Dada Life takes their electro house sound to LAVO this month. Dada Life got their first big break in 2006 with “Big Time,” followed by a steady stream of hit singles like “The Great Fashionista Swindle,” “Vote Yes,” and “Fun Fun Fun,” as well as the full length album ‘Just Do the Dada.’  Dada Life’s tunes are played by everyone from Crookers, Eric Prydz and Benny Benassi to David Guetta; Tiësto quickly understood how to Do the Dada – and the duo played before him on one of his massive U.S. tours. Dada Life have also remixed artists such as Laidback Luke, Alex Gopher, Dan Black/Kid Cudi and more -- always creating new remixes and edits to keep in their arsenal for destroying dancefloors and keeping crowds on their feet all night long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter the <em><strong>Dada Life Remix Contest</strong></em> for "White Noise/Red Meat", "Unleash The Fucking Dada", and "Fight Club Is Closed (It’s Time For Rock ‘n’ Roll)". Don't forget the cowbell! <a href="http://t.ymlp180.net/uuuuuaaayuhataujbakaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Download remix pack here</a>.</p>
