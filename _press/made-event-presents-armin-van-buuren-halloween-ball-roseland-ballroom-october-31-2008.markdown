<strong><br />
Made Event </strong>presents an extra spooky and special Halloween Ball with <strong>Armin Van Buuren</strong> at Roseland Ballroom on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Friday, October 31st, 2008</strong></span>.  Be sure to come adorned in your best Halloween costume as this is surely going to be an All Hallowed Eve for the ages!</p>
<p><strong>Armin Van Buuren</strong> simply put, is one of the greatest trance music producers and DJs of all time; DJ Mag, along with the rest of the world agree, as he was voted number one DJ for 2007 in the magazines annual Top 100 vote.  Being the official World's Best DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the fundamental force behind his success is an overriding passion for dance music.  Even a short list of his recent accomplishments would for many comprise a lifetime body of work: 'Best Album' for artist album "Shivers" at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; 'Best Compilation' for "A State Of Trance", and 'Best Mix Radio Dutch Show' at the Miami Winter Music Conference 2006 for radio show 'A State Of Trance' – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations worldwide as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 6 million listeners a week; and a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia, just to name a very few.</p>
<p>Armada and MySpace have teamed up to take care of your listening pleasure. Members of MySpace are now offered a special and exclusive preview of 'A State of Trance 2008' which can be heard on Armin van Buuren's MySpace profile at <a href="http://">www.myspace.com/arminvanbuuren</a>.</p>
<p>On the October 7th, the fifth edition of Armin van Buuren's stunning and International Dance Music Awards Winning compilation 'A State of Trance' will be released on Ultra Records. 'Armin van Buuren – A State of Trance 2008' is the long expected new album of the award winning sequence and is filled with a range of the most exclusive and hottest tracks around.  The four previous editions of the 'A State of Trance' series were a big success and therefore he chose to continue the concept of ASOT 2006 and 2007; CD1 contains the 'On the Beach' theme and consists of tracks with catchy beats, warm vocals and delicate summer melodies, while CD2 reflects the atmosphere of an Armin performance 'In The Club'.</p>
