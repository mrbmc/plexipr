Made Event presents<br />
MISSTRESS BARBARA<br />
w/ COBBLESTONE JAZZ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents a Canadian tour de force with <strong>Misstress Barbara</strong> and the techno-jazz trio <strong>Cobblestone Jazz</strong> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thursday, February 28th</span></strong>.<br />
<strong><br />
Misstress Barbara</strong> has been busy working on all original material for her forthcoming debut artist album due out in 2008. The album will feature her own vocals along with other guest collaborations including one of her major influences, The Brazilian Girls. Over the years, Misstress Barbara's self-described "drummy funky pumpin' techno" vibe has evolved to one which she feels is more "funky, groovy techno, tech-house and minimal." Also the head of iturnem records, Misstress Barbara continues to tour worldwide this winter and will be performing in Miami during the Winter Music Conference.</p>
<p>The unique <strong>Cobblestone Jazz</strong> trio- Mathew Jonson, Tyger Dhula, and Danuel Tate, combine early computers and analog instruments to create paired down sounds that retain the explosive quality and improvisational style of jazz with a techno dancefloor aesthetic. Through a real time exchange of musical form, language, and ideas, these Canadians provide a continual sense of excitement and discovery for their audience and put on one of the most engaging and innovative live shows in electronic music.</p>
<p>Their first artist album 23 Seconds is a highly anticipated mile marker for Cobblestone. It not only marks the first time the bands tracks are available on CD, but it also documents the improvisational talent that many who have experienced their organic live sets have come to know. It is that very evolution that their live show takes on that is echoed in the sequencing of 23 Seconds. From the sparse album opening "Waiting Room," to closer "W" which is perhaps the most uncharacteristic of the tunes on the album, drawing its influences from early trance, the album grows into itself throughout the 10 tracks. At times exploring its more minimal tendencies and at other times unleashing itself into a glitchy house frenzy. By the end of 23 Seconds, it becomes apparent that these are the musings of a mature group well aware of its unique organic take on the state of electronic music.<br />
