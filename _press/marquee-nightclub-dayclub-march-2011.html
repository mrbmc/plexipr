<p><strong>Friday, March 4 – DIRTY SOUTH ‘STARPHAZING’</strong><br />
Dirty South returns to Marquee after recently being nominated for the ‘Best Remixed Recording’ Grammy award along with Swedish House Mafia’s Axwell for their remix of The Temper Trap’s “Sweet Disposition.” He has also worked with dance music giants David Guetta and Sebastian Ingrosso (“How Soon Is Now”) and remixed some of music’s biggest names, including U2, Snoop Dogg and Depeche Mode. It’s no surprise that he has played for some of the best clubs and festivals across the globe. In between his heavy touring and producing schedule, Dirty South regularly releases compilations for labels such as Ministry Of Sound, Toolroom Records and SONY just to name a few. This past summer saw the birth of the his hit track “Phazing” from his label of the same name, which properly launched as a global clubbing concept, Starphazing, at Marquee Las Vegas and showcases his signature dark house sound and hands-in-the-air good vibes. “Vegas is crazy. Anything happens in Vegas. On top of that, I want people to have fun and enjoy my music. I want all of us to have fun together.”</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, March 5 – ERICK MORILLO ‘SUBLIMINAL SESSIONS’</strong><br />
Erick Morillo’s star-studded Subliminal Sessions residency at Marquee Las Vegas saw Paris and Nicky Hilton dancing behind the DJ booth last month, as well as a rousing performance by Shawnee Taylor, whose vocals are featured in his hit track “Live Your Life.” It’s no surprise that the dazzling, Tron-inspired, futuristic experience is so popular: it breaks all standards of clubbing. Erick is platinum-selling DJ, whose first dancefloor hit was in 1994 with Reel 2 Real’s ubiquitous “I Like To Move It.” Since then, he has developed a funky, soulful house sound, producing more hits, as well as remixes for Whitney Houston and Basement Jaxx, among others. Meanwhile, his Subliminal Records label continues to sign talented artists and deliver quality releases to the discerning dance music cognoscenti. Erick is also the mastermind behind legendary weekly summer parties at Pacha Ibiza and a headliner at many of the world’s top music festivals. He was recently nominated for an International Dance Music Award in the ‘Best American DJ (North America)’ category and Subliminal Records earned a nomination for ‘Best American Record Label.’</p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 7 – REDFOO OF LMFAO ‘PARTY ROCK MONDAYS’</strong><br />
Redfoo of LMFAO and his crew have been bringing madness to Vegas for his Party Rock Mondays residency at Marquee every month, with live vocal performances, customized videos, blow up zebras, go-go dancers decked out in party rock gear: the perfect accoutrements to go along with the hottest new electro house party rock music. This wildly energetic and technically flawless DJ received a 2010 Grammy nomination for LMFAO’s debut album, Party Rock, and has collaborated with some of the industry’s best, including David Guetta, the Black Eyed Peas, Lil Jon and Pitbull. Not to mention his hit remixes for Kanye West’s “Love Lockdown” and Katy Perry’s “Hot N Cold.” Redfoo has performed in over 24 countries on four continents while on tour with LMFAO and the Black Eyed Peas, and through his individual DJ sets. When he’s not spinning the perfect dance mix and throwing an epic party, Redfoo can be found in the studio working on LMFAO’s upcoming album, ‘Sorry For Party Rocking.’ What’s his motto for Party Rock Mondays at Marquee? “Drink, Dance and Party like everyone’s watching!”</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, March 9 – AVICII</strong><br />
Avicii was named Breakthrough DJ/Producer of 2010 by Tiësto in DJ Mag’s Top 100 issue (in which Avicii himself earned a spot at #39) and his current International Dance Music Award nominations include ‘Best Breakthrough Artist (Solo),’ ‘Best Breakthrough DJ’,’ ‘Best Remixer,’  ‘Best Progressive Track’ (for “Seek Bromance”) and ‘Best Commercial Dance Track’ (for “Bromance”). The evidence is clear: this young Swede is one of the biggest up-and-coming DJs in the world.  It’s no surprise that “Seek Bromance” is a gold-selling radio sensation, gaining top 5 spots worldwide, and that “Bromance” has collected over 40 million views on Youtube. Avicii played all over the world last year, including several gigs in Ibiza, as well as Sensation White Festival in St. Petersburg, Surfcomber Pool Party in Miami and Electric Zoo Festival in New York. He has also stamped his unique house sound on remixes for Bob Sinclar, Dizzee Rascal, Sophie Ellis Baxter, Little Boots and David Guetta and has collaborated with Tiesto, Sebastian Ingrosso from Swedish House Mafia and many more. Avicii’s remix of Armin van Buuren’s “Drowning” is currently one of the most sought-after house tracks in the world and his official remix for Daft Punk’s “Derezzed” is coming out next month on the ‘Tron: Legacy R3CONFIGUR3D’ remix album.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, March 11 – ROBBIE RIVERA with BLAKE JARRELL</strong><br />
Robbie Rivera’s distinctive brand of sexy, pounding, dirty, electro-tinged house music ignites dance-floors across the globe, while the world’s top artists queue up to have Robbie put his sound to their tracks. From David Guetta, Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Gabriel &amp; Dresden, Moloko, Bob Sinclar, Benny Benassi, Basement Jaxx and Ferry Corsten to Sinead O’Connor, Kylie Minogue and Madonna, Robbie is respected and beloved by global DJs and artists. Whether he’s headlining open-air summer festival stages, 24-hour superclubs or the hippest ultra-lounges, Robbie Rivera always has a knack for creating dancefloor mayhem. His last artist album, Closer To The Sun, featured international hit singles "Let Me Sip My Drink" feat. Fast Eddie, "Rock The Disco" and "We Live For The Music,” and his syndicated weekly radio show, “Robbie Rivera: The Juicy Show,” (named after his own label Juicy Music) airs on Sirius XM Radio every Friday at midnight EST. Robbie is joined by Chicago-based Blake Jarrell, an extraordinary young artist with an Ibiza summer residency, world tour, and mix compilation for the Armada Dancefloor Sessions series already under his belt. Handpicked by Armin van Buuren himself to join the Armada artist roster, Blake’s original productions and remixes are also supported by Markus Schulz, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, Paul van Dyk, Pete Tong, John Digweed and Paul Oakenfold. His hit “Punta del Este” was featured on Armin’s acclaimed ‘A State of Trance 2008’ compilation and his remix of Moussa Clark’s “She Wants Him” stayed in the #1 position on Beatport’s trance charts for several weeks. Blake’s monthly radio show, “Concentrate” features signature mix sets and special international guests.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, March 12 – KASKADE</strong><br />
Kaskade’s residency at Marquee Las Vegas has proven itself to be absolutely epic: its launch saw this international star play until 8 a.m. and the second installment made him a top Twitter trending topic in Las Vegas. "Residencies are really cool because it gives me an opportunity to build something. Typically, I'm just in a city for one night, but I'm going to be here in Vegas every month, refining it and tweaking it. It really lets me indulge artistically and create a show that's going to be special," says Kaskade about his monthly gig. Kaskade invites clubbers into a spectacular fantasy world, full of beautiful ballerina dancers and thrilling trance, house and pop music, as he indulges his every brilliant artistic impulse and keeps everyone packed on the dancefloor. Kaskade’s soul-lifting electronic music and unmatched versatility have recently earned him International Dance Music Award nominations for ‘Best American DJ (North America),’ ‘Best Full Length DJ Mix,’ ‘Best Artist (Solo)’ and ‘Best Progressive Track’ for “Fire in Your New Shoes” feat. Dragonette. With an IDMA ‘Best Remixer’ Award already under his belt as well as a spot in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs, Kaskade also has several number one iTunes singles and earned headline billing at major music festivals around the world. 2010 saw the release of his sixth artist album Dynasty, which debuted at number 4 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart, as well as the ‘dance.love’ mix compilation.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, March 18 – CHUCKIE ‘‘DIRTY DUTCH RED LIGHT DISTRICT’</strong><br />
Chuckie’s Dirty Dutch Red Light District brings the magic of nightlife in Amsterdam’s Red Light District to Las Vegas. Adapting Amsterdam’s iconic XXX logo, Chuckie’s team presents dazzling custom visuals and alluringly risqué dancers’ costumes to reflect the city’s daring, sophisticated and sexy style.

Chuckie is the mastermind behind the Dirty Dutch phenomenon; famous for its addictive “house with an attitude influenced by hip hop” sound and global house music events.

VONYC Sessions 2010, the second compilation in a series featuring the radio show’s stand-out tracks of the year, is currently dominating the EDM charts. PvD also celebrates his musical achievements with 'Volume', the 2009 album of his best works to date -- encompassing his #1 hit single “Home” and selections from his massive 15-year catalogue, including works from his studio albums '45 RPM' (1994),  'Seven Ways' (1996),  'Out There And Back' (2000), the Grammy-nominated 'Reflections' (2003) and 'In Between' (2007).

<p><strong>Saturday, March 26 – ABOVE &amp; BEYOND ‘GROUP THERAPY IN VEGAS’</strong><br />
The launch of Above &amp; Beyond’s Group Therapy In Vegas residency saw the trio’s innovative brand of euphoric electronic dance music lift spirits and feet off the dancefloor all night with their custom production rig with special lighting and custom visuals.

<p><strong>Monday, March 28 – DJ VICE</strong><br />
DJ Vice’s illustrious career started out at Los Angeles radio station Power 106, which gained him a fan in none other than the legend Dr. Dre. Since then, he’s spun at the biggest parties around the world (London, Paris, Australia, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Mexico, Canada, etc), lent creative input to artists like Timbaland, Kanye and Pharrell, and opened two locations of his own sneaker store, CRSVR, one of which is located right inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel of Las Vegas, alongside the Marquee nightclub itself. DJ Vice is known for crossing genres with ease: not just hip hop, but house, dance and rock music too. He has become a Las Vegas nightlife fixture within the last few years -- spinning alongside celebrity emcees like Jay-Z, Usher, DIddy and Young Jeezy every night -- so it’s only natural that he joined the immensely talented DJ lineup at Marquee Las Vegas.</p>
