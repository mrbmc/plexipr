<p style="text-align: left;">On President’s Day, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday, February 15th</span></strong>, Club World’s ‘Best Superclub’ <strong>Pacha NYC</strong>, brings you two of New York’s dance music titans. Whether it’s behind the decks, in the studio, or at the helm of their respective labels, <strong>PETER</strong> <strong>RAUHOFER</strong> and <strong>JUNIOR VASQUEZ </strong>both possess the Midas touch.</p>
<p>When it comes to achievements within the worldwide dance music scene, <strong>Peter Rauhofer</strong> has few equals. A lauded producer, remixer, DJ and label owner - Star 69 Record, he has spent the last twenty years establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with in an industry where many merely come and go. From a long, vaulted career his accolades includes remixes for everyone from Madonna to Yoko Ono, a multitude of massive club and chart hits, a world famous record label, at the helm of New York City’s most thrilling club nights – Work, and the recipient of a prestigious Grammy award - Remixer of The Year.  Now, Peter’s upcoming album on Star 69 is the 4th in his highly acclaimed “I Love”… series, entitled “I Love Paris”.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Vasquez</strong> is a bona fide DJ legend. Having invented the notion of the superstar DJ, Junior brings a wealth of experience to the DJ booth, mixing cutting-edge anthems with classic styles that have been his trademark oeuvre. With his pulse on today’s dancefloor, Junior’s remixes of Britney Spears' singles from her recent Billboard #1 album Circus include; “Womanizer” and a trifecta of remixes for “Circus” on maxi single to be released in February. Newly reinvigorated, Junior’s new label Be Quiet Music is storming the clubs with “Don’t Stop” and “I’m in Love” featuring Maxi J. Come President’s Day, Vasquez will bring his  divergent blend of genre-smashing, pulsing hooks with Red Hot &amp; Dirty house choice cuts for an all-day dance extravaganza.</p>
