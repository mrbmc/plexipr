Made Event presents<br />
SOS<br />
(Desyn Masiello, Omid 16B and Demi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents UK DJ collective <strong>SOS</strong>, comprised of Desyn Masiello, Omid 16B and Demi, for an extended Halloween Bash like none other in New York City, downstairs at <strong>Rebel</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, November 1st</strong></span>. ]</p>
<p>Individually they are dynamite; collectively they are the bomb. These guys are taking the art of DJing, moving it forward and making it truly progressive.  As friends, producers, DJs, label owners – and model clubland citizens – Demi, Desyn and Omid are three of the most passionate talents working in electronic music today. Taking inspiration from their SexOnWax and Deeper Substance imprints to form<strong> SOS</strong> in 2004, they've built a first-rate reputation for quality music, inventive mixing and an infectious party spirit, whether it's on a boat along the Thames, deep inside Bedrock or Ministry of Sound, or glowing in the sun in Ibiza or Miami. Like Danny Krivit, François K and Joe Claussell's legendary Body &amp; Soul connection before them, the chemistry between the members of SOS makes for a proper three-headed DJ monster.</p>
<p>Balance 013, released earlier this year marks the first time the trio has committed their energetic and eclectic sound to CD, and the result is nothing short of mind-blowing. Having locked themselves away for weeks, submerged in their home studios, SOS painstakingly programmed and pieced together a three-disc opus using many of their signature re-edits, top-drawer treasures from underground troves, and a few kinky surprises out of left field.</p>
<p>SOS has been busy tearing up dance floors across the globe on their Balance 013 world tour and now its New York City's turn as the final North American leg comes to an end.  Don't miss this one - as you undoubtedly will regret it.</p>
<p><em>Balance 013 mixed by SOS (3xCD) is out now on EQ Recordings.</em></p>
