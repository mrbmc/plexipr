SUNDAY SCHOOL FOR DEGENERATES<br />
Miami 2009<br />
The 24 Hour Party<br />
Ice Palace, Miami</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adultnapper // Argy // Barem // Cassy // DJ Connie // Guy Gerber (live) // Ida Engberg // Joris Voorn (exclusive) // Marco Carola // Martin Buttrich (live) // Martin Landsky // Matthew Dear // Mr. C // Onur Özer (exclusive) // Ryan Crosson (exclusive live set) // Seth Troxler // Solomun // Steve Bug // Stimming (live)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>*Powered by Integral Sound</em></p>
<p><strong>Sunday School For Degenerates</strong> is readying itself for a marathon session of massive proportions. Sunday School tickets will be valid for the full 24 hours and include a re-entry wristband. Get the party started right: Come by early to pick up your wristband and have a Degenerate drink on the house during the early <strong>OPEN BAR</strong> (11pm-12am) and be sure to catch the exclusive live set from Detroit’s new breed <strong>Ryan Crosson</strong> with his percussive programming, dubby basslines, and dark atmospheres. The Ice Palace is located close to the nightclub district, so you can make the rounds. Or, like a true Degenerate, stay for the duration as class will be in session all night and day, with a line-up that is sure to school you.</p>
<p><strong>NEW ARTISTS &amp; EXCLUSIVES</strong><br />
NYC’s techno femme fatale <strong>DJ Connie</strong> leads off the night, followed by <strong>Ryan Crosson</strong>’s exclusive live set and Poker Flat artist Argy, for his long-awaited U.S. debut after last year’s visa snafu. Then, Turkey’s first real techno export <strong>Onur Özer</strong> will play his exclusive Miami set for another U.S. debut! Özer’s talents have made him one of the most critically acclaimed names in electronic music rising out of the most oriental parts of Europe. Germany’s <strong>Martin Buttrich</strong> returns with his midas touch for another explosive live set replete with his own golden productions. On the eve of his stunning CD kaleidoscope <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 014</span>, <strong>Joris Voorn</strong> joins the fray with his exclusive Miami performance. The future of DJing may lie in Voorn’s ability to simultaneously mix multiple tracks at once into entirely new soundscapes. Finally, Sunday School favorite <strong>Cassy</strong> returns for another indelible set to celebrate the final hours of degeneracy.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ICE PALACE</strong><br />
Both the indoor and outdoor spaces will feature a complete sound system installed and engineered by Integral Sound, now tantamount with the highest quality. At night, the lobby will be transformed into the Degenerates den with a wood beam ceiling encasing a wonderfully warm sound with an adjacent open-air terrace. In the early morning, the 30,000 square foot Ice Palace lawn will be a green grass playground with seating, hammocks, a coconut tree vista, and plenty of shade. There will be a full bar available for the entire 24 hours, along with food available for purchase, including vegetarian options. Get ready for the one party to rule them all!</p>
