Made Event presents<br />
Sébastien Léger (France)<br />
w/ Sleepy &amp; Boo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents French DJ and producer sensation<strong> Sébastien Léger</strong> at <strong>Cielo NYC </strong>with Sleepy &amp; Boo on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, July 25th, 2008</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Over the last decade Sébastien Léger has become one of France's most revered DJ/producers. Eschewing the more obvious French filter house clichés his productions have taken on the robust dancefloor edge of his beloved Chicago house heroes and twisted them into his own electronic masterpieces.</p>
<p>Parallel to building his international DJ career Sébastien Léger has also become one of the world's most in demand remixers, working for artists such as Armand Van Helden, Kevin Saunderson, Jakatta, Paul Johnson and more recently turning in remixes for Dave Gahan, Kylie Minogue, Duran Duran, Groove Armada and Justin Timberlake. After his debut artist album Atomic Pop in 1999, which included a guest appearance by Junior Sanchez, Léger continues to remain focussed on developing his own sound via his own imprint Mistakes Music that is indelibly stamped with his trademark techno-funk sound.</p>
<p>As a consequence of his continued progression in his production work, the great variety of house music colour in his tracks, the construction and arrangement of his electro and funk-infused rhythms, the now Amsterdam based Sébastien Léger has established his position at the forefront of reconstructing contemporary electronic music. Garnering high praise for his recent debut on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix in May 2008, Sébastien Léger is well on his way to conquering dancefloors all over the world.</p>
