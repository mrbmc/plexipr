<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> returns to New York after a week of wildly successful parties at Winter Music Conference with record attendance and sold-out, at-capacity shows. Amidst the frenzy, Pacha NYC brings home five Disco Globes for the 2009 <strong>Club World Awards</strong>, including top honors for; ‘<em><strong>Best Superclub</strong></em>’, ‘<em><strong>Best Resident DJ</strong></em>’ – <strong>Victor Calderone</strong>, ‘<em><strong>Best Resident LJ</strong></em>’ – <strong>Timmy Lights</strong>, ‘<em><strong>Best DJ Set</strong></em>’ - <strong>David Guetta</strong> and '<em><strong>Best One Off</strong></em>' - <strong>One Night Only: An AM Only Event</strong>. This is the first time that any venue has received the top recognition for <em>Best Superclub</em> three years in a row.</p>
<p>At the <strong>24th annual International Dance Music Awards</strong> (IDMAs) held at the Winter Music Conference, the dance music industry gathered to celebrate and pay tribute to exceptional achievements and innovation throughout the year. Over 10,000 ballots were tallied in 50 categories for the most pioneering and elite artist, technology and professionals in the business and in the category of ‘<em>Best U.S. Club</em>’; Pacha NYC beat out tough competition from Miami, Las Vegas, NYC and Chicago. In addition to the accolades in Miami, from across the pond, the UK’s international clubbing bible <strong>DJ Mag</strong> ranks the “The World’s Best Clubs” in its annual April roundup. The internationally renown Pacha flagship club, Pacha Ibiza ranked #7 and Pacha NYC came in at #30 worldwide.</p>
<p>After a successful week of awards and Pacha parties all over Miami, Eddie Dean co-owner of Pacha NYC exuded, “<em>This year we really sought to make our presence known and brought the Pacha brand to Miami by taking over the Royal Palms Hotel for the week and hosting pool parties and nightclub parties at various venues with some of our biggest DJs.  By importing our own support staff of managers, dancers, security, promotions team and PR, we were able to continue to bring the superior quality of nightlife professionalism that is associated with the Pacha brand. We’re proud of all of our accomplishments and strive year-round to provide excellence for our clientele at every level. </em>On the multitude of awards, Dean continued, “<em>To be recognized by the industry for these top awards really is an honor and it will be something that is shared by all of us, each night on the dancefloor as we continue to recreate the magic each and every weekend.”</em></p>
<p>Over the last 3 years, Pacha NYC has risen to the top of North America’s clubbing capital and has become a staple in NYC's nightlife, by attracting the most sought after global DJs with an international, cosmopolitan clubbing clientele. Week after week Pacha NYC delivers the very best clubbing nights with the venue's over-the-top debauchery, performances, spectacular sound, quality production and dazzling lighting.</p>
