Made Event presents<br />
ARMIN VAN BUUREN<br />
@ McCarren Pool</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents DJ Mag's #1 DJ in the world <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> at Brooklyn's outdoor mega-venue <strong>McCarren Park Pool</strong> for a solo DJ concert this summer on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, July 5th.</strong></span></p>
<p>Last year <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> debuted at the former 50,000 square foot NYC public pool to an ecstatic crowd numbering over 3,000. During last year's show, the epic day-to-night event featured a stunning sunset that set the stage for a spectacular and powerful canopy of laser disco lights like effect for Armin's epic soundtrack. Now in a bold move owing to his ever-growing popularity, Armin will be performing solo at New York's coolest concert space and quite possibly the last DJ event of this caliber, as McCarren Park Pool undergoes a major renovation in 2009.</p>
<p>Armin van Buuren returns to NYC on the heels of his hotly anticipated third artist album <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMAGINE</span></strong> out now on Ultra Records. The album is a testament to his ongoing transition from producer to fully-fledged artist, and is the perfect amalgamation of beats and electronica with lush chords and songwriting.</p>
<p>While trance's universal appeal and Armin's dedication to the genre have contributed to his huge global success, including a radio show that broadcasts on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 6 million listeners a week, Armin's albums are more than a series of identical trance tracks based on an 8-bar loop. Imagine is the product of two years' work, with tracks recorded across 8 locations - everywhere from Washington to Holland, and LA to Ireland - and featuring a number of vocals, from the sublime tones of American Jennifer Rene to the rock-friendly sound of Liverpudlian Chris Jones on "Going Wrong."</p>
<p>The internationally celebrated DJ Armin van Buuren quickly rose to fame in the dance music arena over the last 6 years with the success of both his music career and his label &amp; management company, Armada.  As a result, he was crowned the #1 DJ in the world by the notorious DJ Mag poll in November 2007. Born in Leiden, Holland, former law student van Buuren now sells out venues from Europe to Russia, the Middle East to the United States, with a recent sold-out Armin Only event in the Netherlands with 16,000!</p>
<p>Join us as NYC's premiere electronic dance music event promotions company Made Event presents a full-scale production with customized Integral Sound, along with spectacular lasers &amp; lighting effects at this unique landmark outdoor concert venue for the most memorable fresh air DJ experience of the summer!</p>

<p><em>"[McCarren Park Pool] New York's freshest, coolest concert space."</em> – New York<br />
<em><br />
"[Armin van Buuren 2007]…an all-ages, open-air dance music extravaganza." </em>– Remix</p>
<p><em>"Armin van Buuren, one of the most energetic, infectious and engaging DJ's around…As the sun went down, laser lights played along the back walls of the complex, and the Intelligent Lighting system, fog machine, and short movies shown on  the two screens flanking Armin helped to create a feeling of a musical oasis." – EDGE NY<br />
"Smiling the entire time, the charismatic Armin spun an arresting four and a half hour trance set full of dramatic build-ups and tumultuous drops as the sun set…A true master of his genre, his performances are not to be missed!"</em> – New York Press</p>
