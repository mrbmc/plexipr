<em>The one and only Dutch king Marco V lays down some serious tracks, spanning the world of dance music - from trance to techno and beyond. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> is proud to present the Pacha debut of Dutch DJ hero <strong>Marco V</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, February 5th, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Some people are born with the music running through their veins and <strong>Marco V</strong> is most definitely one of them.  Like many of the world’s superstar DJs, Marco honed his musical skills in his home country of The Netherlands.   However, few have done more for dance music then he has. Inspiring new producers and DJ’s every day, he is frequently described as the preeminent DJ’s DJ, with many of his colleagues stating him as their primary influence.  When Marco steps behind the turntables he holds complete control of the crowd.   Bringing them a style that is not easily defined, he can incorporate anything from fierce electro to driving techno and trance. Travel the globe and you’ll be hard pushed find a dancefloor that hasn’t felt his force.</p>
<p>In the studio Marco has released some of the decade’s most recognizable dance anthems. Classics such as “Indicator”, “Godd”, “Second Bite”, and “Red Blue Purple” have all found themselves emanating from the speakers of the world premier clubs and festivals. Marco has also been known to lend his unique touch to established classics like “Café Del Mar” and “Loops &amp; Tings Relooped”, updating them for the latest generations of fans. Now, after the highly successful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combi:Nations</span> mix series and two artist albums we see Marco’s most ambitious project yet.  His 3rd artist album <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Propaganda</span></strong> is set to be released in an unprecedented two parts. With part 1 available and part 2 on the way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Propaganda</span> provides Marco a platform which can span his entire musical spectrum.</p>
