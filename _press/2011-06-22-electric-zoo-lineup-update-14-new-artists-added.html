<p>As the name suggests, Randall's Island Park is on an island, and moving large numbers of people on and off such a small island with limited entry points in a safe and efficient manner is a challenge. When you decide to come to Electric Zoo, it's important to us that your trip here (and back home again each night) is as swift and easy as possible. That's why this year we are providing several different transportation options that are bundled with festival passes. And it's important for festival goers to make their transportation plans early.  For those planning on coming to Electric Zoo in a friend's car, by taxi or some other mode of dropoff, or MTA bus, please be aware that you should buy your festival passes NOW. Within the next few weeks, festival passes that do not include a transportation option will sell out. After that point, the only way to buy a festival pass will be to buy one that's bundled with a transportation option (ferry, shuttle bus, or parking pass).</p>
