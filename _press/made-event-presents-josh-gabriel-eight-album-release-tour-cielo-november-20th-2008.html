Made Event presents<br />
Josh Gabriel<br />
Eight' Album Release Tour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the highly anticipated return of one of America's most talented DJ/Producers, <strong>Josh Gabriel</strong>, for his<em> 'Eight'</em> album release tour in New York at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, November 20th , 2008</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Now with acclaimed solo success, <strong>Josh Gabriel</strong> touches down in New York City to display his talent and promote his new, freshly inspired music.  Gabriel 's most recent release comes in the form of a debut solo artist album, 'Eight', his latest collection of tracks from the perspective of a dance floor purist, while at the same time imprinting enough soul to reach anyone, thanks to his brand of musical techno and groundbreaking production. As a marked departure from his previous work, Gabriel's solo work hones in on his darker, effusive musical house and techno side. This "clubber's album," consistent with music that he would play in a DJ set, includes the first single "Summit", the techno sensation Gabriel made in 2007 that was played by DJs such as John Digweed and Sander Kleinenberg, and was also chosen by DJ Magazine as one of the top tracks of 2007.</p>
<p>This fall, Josh Gabriel also announced the launch of Different Pieces, an independent record label and management group that integrates all aspects of an artist's career. Gabriel founded the company with long-time business manager Guy Ornadel and his wife, Kristy Gabriel.  Together, they deliver a unique depth of experience by combining their individual strengths in music, artist marketing, and the related business aspects that drive and build artist's career.</p>
<p>Josh Gabriel's reputation for amazing shows and sounds has gained him fans from all corners of the world and he continues to produce and perform at the top of his game and is continuing to reach new heights. Josh rose to international fame as part of the duo Gabriel &amp; Dresden, winning seven industry awards for producing, songwriting and DJing - and achieving seventeen number #1 Billboard Dance Chart hits.</p>
