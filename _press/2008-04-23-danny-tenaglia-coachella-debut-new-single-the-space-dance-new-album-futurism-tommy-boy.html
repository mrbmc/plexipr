<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Danny Tenaglia Coachella Debut!<br />
New Single “The Space Dance” &amp; New Album ‘Futurism’ (Tommy Boy)<br />
+ Upcoming Tour Dates</strong></p>
<p>There are few living dance music legends as globally renowned as New York's <strong>Danny Tenaglia</strong>. With over 30+ years of dancefloor expertise, Danny has carved an indelible mark on electronic dance music both past, present and future. Now starring in his <strong>Coachella Valley Music &amp; Arts Festival</strong> debut on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunday, April 27th</strong></span> in the Dance tent, Danny is set to proselytize with his revered collection of music from the annals of dance music's catalog to an all-ages audience for the first time ever in the desert.</p>
<p>After a long studio silence, Danny re-emerges with a stunning new single "The Space Dance" on the legendary Tommy Boy label to commemorate his first-ever, weekly residency at global clubbing institution Space Ibiza beginning in July 2008. His latest production resonates with hooks that sound simultaneously familiar and avant-garde, making "The Space Dance" an instant classic. Look for "The Space Dance" to be this summer's Ibiza anthem.</p>
<p>With a new compilation album on the horizon, Danny will be supporting the release with his first-ever full North American tour in Fall 2008.</p>
<p>**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Danny Tenaglia will be available for press previews and on-site interviews at Coachella - Sunday, April 27th</span>. Please send us your request for single/album promos.</p>
