Available Now Digitally</strong></p>

This series of dubSpot-produced benefit compilations will raise funds for various projects by harnessing the positive power of music. The goal for this compilation is to raise awareness and much needed funds for African children orphaned by the AIDS crisis. <strong> BFM Digital, Inc</strong>. is on board to digitally distribute the release globally.</p>
<p>The nationwide release party is scheduled for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 7, 2009</strong></span> at the <strong>Elbo Room</strong> in <strong>San Francisco</strong> (647 Valencia St., SF, CA 94110) featuring J Boogie, DJ OBaH, Happy Mayfield (live), and the Pleasuremaker Band.  For more information on this release and the event, please visit <a href="http://">www.funkaid.com</a>.

<p><strong>Dan Giove</strong>, the founder of <strong>dubSpot</strong>, has always believed that education is fundamentally steeped in the ethics of altruism and selflessness. Much of the musical community shares in this feeling; it’s just not about the individual.  It is in this spirit that all of the musicians involved with the Funk Aid mix have generously donated their art and their time in deference to a greater cause.  Most important, 100% of the proceeds from the sale of this compilation are going directly to charity.  These funds will aid in the construction a ‘green’ environment, including a playground and nursery school, for the children of Youth with a Vision (YWAV), a South African organization that runs AIDS prevention programs in Dennilton, South Africa. These facilities are part of NextAid’s and YWAV's 20 structure children's village that will house 30 children orphaned by AIDS, an after-school center for hundreds of children living off site, and an economic hub for the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Funk Aid has been incredibly well received by the musical community, both for its motives and its quality.  <strong>Gunnar Hissam</strong> of <strong>Om Records</strong> says that “<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Funk Aid for Africa</span> is everything a good mix CD should be, funky, uplifting and for the children.  Props go out to all the musicians for donating the amazing music and for dubSpot and NextAid for making it all happen.  God bless you!</em>”</p>
<p>The May 7th event will mark the first leg of an 8-city DubSpot tour.  The ‘<em><strong>Ableton Live 8 U.S. Sessions Tour</strong></em>,’ is a series of weekend workshops designed to showcase the best of what dubSpot’s school has to offer.  With multiple sections planned each day, these presentations will feature dubSpot instructors and nationally renowned artists alike.  Each session will detail the essentials of musical production and performance, while using the most advanced production software available: Ableton Live 8.
