<strong>Made Event presents</strong><br />
<strong>SAVE THE CANNIBALS</strong><br />
<strong>featuring<br />
ADULTNAPPER &amp;</strong><br />
<strong>BRUNO PRONSATO (live)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Event</strong> continues strong into the New Year with the second installment of NYC’s newest techno weekly – <em><strong>Save </strong><strong>the Cannibals</strong></em>. At the helm of this week’s edition is Brooklyn’s own Techno philosopher <strong>ADULTNAPPER</strong> and Berlin transplant, by way of Seattle, sound scientist<strong> BRUNO PRONSATO</strong>.  Come join the madness that kicked off with Steve Bug last week as we venture into the heart of techno. This week all dinner guests can sign up to be added to the Save the Cannibals Reduced List for $15 ADMISSION BEFORE 12:30AM. The upstairs at Rebel will provide the intimacy of a small dance boite, along with exceptional sound with a complete new sound system installed and engineered by Integral Sound.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NYC’s arch tech selector <strong>ADULTNAPPER</strong> is a shadowy figure drawn from the dark reaches of Francis Harris' imagination. His introspective productions defy convention, relying instead on a sophisticated, song-based approach, marked by elaborate swung micro-rhythms, thick musical baselines, complex arrangements and haunting tonal melodies. As a DJ, primarily on vinyl, Harris employs precision skills and thoughtful programming to expand upon Adultnapper’s sonic territory, earning him turns on the world’s most discerning dancefloors with his trademark emotion-laden rides. In 2007, Harris launched his enigmatic Ransom Note label which features the deeper side of Adultnapper alongside some of his favorite contemporaries, many drawn from his Brooklyn environs. The first three releases have featured challenging musical contributions from Alexi Delano, Camea, Matt Tolfrey &amp; Inxec. Ransom Note’s sub-label Footnote exposes the raw house side of Adultnapper's world with outings so far by Beat Pharmacy, Nick Chacona, Tommy Bones, (a)pendics.shuffle, Mikael Stravostrand, Holmar Filipsson and Rekleiner. Next up is Brendon Moeller/Beat Pharmacy under his Echologist guise with “The Score,” which lands on vinyl with remixes by Adultnapper &amp; Jus Ed in mid-February, and on digital with a bonus cut in March. 2009 will see both labels widen their roster with releases lined up by Jay Tripwire, Touane, Anthony Parasole &amp; Fred P./Black Jazz Consortium, Theodor Zox and Vincenzo, while Adultnapper continues his prolific studio work with additional releases due on Clink Recordings, Crosstown Rebels Digital and his debut on Poker Flat Recordings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Joining Adultnapper for this techno journey is <strong>BRUNO PRONSATO</strong> with a special live performance.  Pronsato’s mix of playful yet rigorous music has brought him to all corners of the techno universe. Following his latest fantastic album “Why Can’t We Be Like Us", Bruno releases another timeless pearl, magical vocal track “Nobody Calls” on label Hello?Repeat. On the flip side, a fairly dirty track called “Where’d You Learn To Kiss That Way" gets a little gritty with a uniquely deep, glorious atmosphere. Over the years, Bruno has released music on prestigious techno imprints such as Orac, Musique Risquee, Milnor Modern, Telegraph, Philpot, and Perlon, and in 2007 he found his way into techno’s epicenter, Berlin and formed Half Hawaii with Perlon’s Sammy Dee. Regardless of geography one thing is certain, Bruno’s music constantly pushes the boundaries of techno and experimental while always remaining undeniably danceable.</p>
