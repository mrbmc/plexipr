<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/agoriaagoria"><img class="size-full wp-image-2113 aligncenter" title="Agoria North American Tour" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Agoria.jpg" alt="Agoria North American Tour" width="306" height="306" /></a></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AGORIA 'BALANCE 016' NORTH AMERICAN TOUR DATES<br />
Including, Movement Electronic Music Festival - Main Stage Performance</strong></p>
<p>Hot off the heels of his acclaimed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance</span> series edition and a successful Winter Music Conference debut, forward-thinking Frenchman <strong>Agoria </strong>is set to embark on his North American tour as he makes his way to the <em>Movement Electronic Music Festival</em> in Detroit. With his recent spell-binding DJ sets at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 16: Agoria</span> release party and at the infamous <strong>Sunday School For Degenerates</strong> party in Miami, Agoria is now ready to bring his distinct track selection and mixing style to some of North America’s most forward thinking venues.  Kicking off in New York City, with stops in Windsor, Detroit, and El Paso, the tour culminates with a much anticipated main stage performance at the10th anniversary of the electronic music festival in Detroit.</p>
<p>Agoria, otherwise known as <strong>Sebastien Devaud</strong> wasn’t bitten by the dance music bug until he was out of his teens, but once he began hunting imported 12”s from the US and Germany in his native France, there was no turning back. His production career began in 1999, with his debut album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blossom</span> and first compilation following in 2003 – and it was clear even in those early days that a serious new talent was emerging.  Blending the throb and groove of deeper, stripped-back techno with a keen sense of musicality, emotion and atmosphere, his is a sound that transcends beyond mere dancefloor disposability. His 2007 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At The Controls</span> compilation set a new standard for minimal tech-house with its impeccable programming and seductive mixing.</p>
<p>2010 has marked a banner year for Agoria with the release of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 016</span>.  After raising the bar to unprecedented heights in 2009 with Joris Voorn and Will Saul’s stunning additions to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance</span> series, Agoria provides yet another standard-setting mix from one of the most sophisticated, forward thinking, and inspiring names in techno.  “<em>The concept of both CDs is all about balance. Literally. In my mind a balance is not a middle position; it’s a perfect equilibrium. I’m trying to be as close as possible to this idea. I have tried to find this fine line where the balance is just right.</em>”  To accomplish this perfectly-weighted contrast, he’s cherry-picked from a myriad of genres and subgenres in his “<em>beat open-minded</em>” fashion, combining a wealth of material from newcomers across the spectrum (including no less than 12 exclusives!) with more established producers, classics and unknown gems from his broad musical past, and put it all together in an unconventional, challenging manner. “<em>In the end, more than a DJ compilation, this is a manifesto of my passion for music and for mixing</em>” he explains.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Balance 016: Agoria</span> has been hailed as the compilation of the month by several publications including <strong>IDJ Magazine</strong>, <strong>Tillate Magazine</strong>, <strong>Raveline</strong>, <strong>Tsugi</strong>, <strong>DMC</strong>, <strong>Inpress</strong>, <strong>3D</strong>, <strong>Time Off</strong>.  This superb compilation is as deep and rewarding as a well-woven novel, the dénouement of the story unfolding as the mix evolves through Agoria’s musical DNA. Yet another essential addition to the compilation series that is fast becoming the new benchmark for ambitious DJs and demanding listeners alike.</p>
<p>"<em>Serious dance music fans know the "Balance" label CD series provides some of the most stunning sonic journeys that progressive house and techno has to offer. Recent masterpieces include creative sets by Joris Voorn and Will Saul, but the latest release by Agoria, a French DJ also known as Sebastien Devaud, might top them all.</em>"<br />
