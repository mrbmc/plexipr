<p><em>Made Event presents the NYC debut of renowned Swedish DJ and producer ERIC PRYDZ at Pacha NYC on Friday, November 16th, 2007. This marks the long-anticipated North American debut of a rising star.</em></p>
<p>Eric Prydz propelled to fame after his 2004 hit single "Call on Me" topped the UK singles charts for five weeks and held the number one spot on the German Top100 for six consecutive weeks. Earlier this year, Prydz released a blistering track sampling Pink Floyd's "Another Brick In The Wall" into Eric Prydz vs. Floyd "Proper Education" on Ministry of Sound. This is the first time a Pink Floyd record has ever officially been cleared. Lacing David Gilmour's caliginous vocals with an immense electro bassline, Prydz builds on the epic nature of the original, molding it into a bouncy slice of crossover brilliance. Using both the original vocal and other musical elements of the 1979 hit, the Swedish house don gives a respectful nod to the anti-establishment aesthetics of the record, while perfectly bringing it up to date, giving it a new lease of life for another assault on the charts.</p>
<p>The video for "Proper Education" set off its own sensation with a poignant environmental message and timely focus on climate change and the issues surrounding global warming. Set in a London estate, it features a gang of young people breaking into local flats, in order to switch appliances off standby, change light bulbs for energy efficient alternatives, place bricks in toilet cisterns, alongside a series of other energy saving measures.</p>
<p>Eric Prydz is on a roll at the moment, without doubt leading the way. His labels Mouseville, Pryda Recordings and Pryda Friends are positively brimming with underground club hits. Eric is now in charge of three highly respected labels whose releases are in feverish demand, consistently selling huge quantities of vinyl which is truly incredible in the markets current climate. The labels are arguably proving to be the most successful and forward thinking imprints currently existing. Each label was strictly developed to give Eric a platform to release his own productions without outside interference, simply his music on his terms. It was important for Eric to step back after his previous successes and release music without schedules and pressure. Ultimately he wanted to control his own image and destiny, something extremely important to him and his career. The ethos behind the labels was truly underground, scarcely any promotion, no press intrusion and true label design/identity... a formula which has proven massively successful.</p>
<p>As Mouseville Records and Pryda continue to deliver the dancefloor goods, Eric Prydz is now one of the world's most in demand underground spinners and producers. With his debut artist album and new single set to drop, Eric continues his upward trajectory and propulsion onto dancefloors around the world.</p>
