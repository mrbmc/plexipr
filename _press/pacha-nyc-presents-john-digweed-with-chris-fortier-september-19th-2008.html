Pacha NYC presents<br />
JOHN DIGWEED<br />
along with<br />
CHRIS FORTIER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC </strong>welcomes back UK superstar DJ <strong>JOHN DIGWEED</strong> with his forward-thinking, fresh, driving, hypnotic, melodious house music on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, September 19th, 2008</strong></span> for an unforgettable night with one of the finest musical selectors, along with longtime cohort <strong>Chris Fortier</strong> of Fade Records.</p>
<p>To coincide with the tenth anniversary of Bedrock parties in London, UK and the fast approaching 10th anniversary of Bedrock Records; <strong>John Digweed</strong> releases the triple-disc mix 'Bedrock 10 Past present and future` through his own Bedrock Records. Compiling and mixing a stunning collection of remixes that shine new light on the label's back catalogue alongside the cuts that are currently representing the distinguished Bedrock sound.</p>
<p>From its inception in Hastings during the mid-nineties and subsequent progression to Heaven on 8th October 1998 the Bedrock parties have consistently been a byword for forward-thinking, underground electronic music that attracted the absolute cream of national and international DJ'ing talent. Reaching far further than it's UK-based home, Bedrock has touched down at festivals and club nights across the globe, with America, Japan, Ibiza, Romania, Australia and Dubai just a few of those countries lucky enough to absorb the full Bedrock experience.</p>
<p>Around the same time as those initial parties at Heaven, John set about creating a label that would fit the ethos of the club night's innovative and cutting edge music policy and Bedrock Records was born. Even in it's embryonic stage around 1999 the imprint seemed destined to set the dance music stratosphere ablaze with its maiden release 'Heaven Scent' garnering an almost unanimous 'instant classic' billing. The highlights to date have been almost innumerable but Science Departments 'Persuasion/Repercussion', Steve Lawler's 'Rise In' and Saint's and Sinner's 'Pushin' Too Hard' and Guy Gerbers 'Stoppage Time' as well as albums from Pole Folder and Suicide Sports Club have all provided some truly standout moments. More recently the future of the label has been masterfully entrusted to Israeli wonder-kid Guy J, who's soon to be released debut artist album 'Esperanza' serves as a fantastic snapshot of where Bedrock Records is at in 2008.</p>
<p>So to 'Bedrock 10 Past present and Future' and to honour this massive occasion John has drafted in a careful selection of remix heavyweights to shed new light on some of the labels biggest tracks along with a tidy fistful of the labels freshest output all blended to perfection in the inimitable John Digweed mixing style.</p>
