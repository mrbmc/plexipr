<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>August 11 – Stafford Brothers</strong><br />
The DJ duo known as the Stafford Brothers are currently trekking their way to international stardom. Composed of Matt and Chris Stafford, the pair released their first single in 2006, a cover of “More Than a Feeling” by the band Boston. That same year the brothers signed a record deal with the Australian dance music label Central Station Records, now owned by Ministry of Sound Australia, and later with Hussle Recordings and MoSA. During this time they released the single “Wherever,” a collaboration with the Hoxton Whores featuring Frank Stafford on vocals, which reached #2 on the Aria Club Chart. In late 2009, The Stafford Brothers began to work with international record labels. “Come My Way,” a collaboration with UK producer Tom Neville (also featuring Frank Stafford on vocals), was released by Toolroom Records. Recently, the duo collaborated with Dubruck &amp; Klein along with Ollie James on vocals for the single “Get Away,” which was released on Armin Van Buuren’s Armada Music. The Stafford Brothers recently wrapped up their first official world tour, with 35 shows covering Australia, Asia, The Americas and Europe, and on June 4th 2012 they released their latest single “Pressure” on Cr2 Records. Be sure to catch these superstar DJs when they take over LAVO on August 11.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>August 23 – Dash Berlin</strong><br />
An invigorating and charismatic voice in the EDM scene, Dash Berlin has the unique ability to leave a long-lasting impression upon his audience well after the night is over. The public face of the Dutch progressive-trance project is DJ Jeffrey Sutorius. Inspired by producers like Sven Vath, Oliver Lieb and Sander Kleinenberg, Sutorius began mixing and producing his own music. In 2006 he linked up with friends and fellow producers Kalberg and Molijn to form Dash Berlin. Their breakthrough came with the single “Till the Sky Falls Down.” The track skyrocketed to the top of the Trance charts with a help from Armin van Buuren, who then signed them to his label, Armada Music. October 2009 brought the global release of Dash Berlin’s acclaimed debut album, “The New Daylight,” which featured, “Till the Sky Falls Down,” “Man on the Run” and “Waiting.” A world tour followed with notable appearances at Trance Energy, A State Of Trance 450 and Dance Valley. On April 27th, 2012, Dash Berlin released their second artist album, #musicislife, which contains the hits; "Disarm Yourself,” "Better Half Of Me,” "World Falls Apart,” "Go It Alone" and "Apollo Road.” Their latest single from the album, "Silence In Your Heart," dropped July 16th. Dash also has a new free download available from his <a href="http://t.ymlp297.net/uhhehagabsuyagaesqaxaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">SoundCloud page</a> - "DJ Ease My Apollo Road." For an experience that transcends music, do not miss Dash Berlin at LAVO on August 23rd.</p>
