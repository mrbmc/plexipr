<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, December 1<sup>st</sup> – Tiësto</strong><br />
Tiësto's career is all about firsts. He was the first DJ to play live on stage at the Summer Olympics, and was the first DJ to achieve consecutive #1 spots on DJ Mag's Top 100. He was also the first DJ to ever headline a stadium concert and the first DJ to headline Coachella. His legendary career has touched three decades now as one of the all-time greats in electronic dance music. 2011 has been a bustling year for the Dutch maestro: January saw him named Mixmag's "Greatest DJ Of All Time," he has released the hits "C'mon" with Diplo, "Zero 76" with Hardwell, and "Tornado" with Steve Aoki, not to mention his latest hit single "Maximal Crazy," all while continuing to tour the globe, headlining festivals like New York's Electric Zoo Festival, and producing his award-winning weekly radio show, Club Life. His return trip to LAVO on December 1st will prove to be one of the most epic parties of the season at New York's most renowned dance boite.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Friday, December 9th - Redfoo of LMFAO &amp; The Party Rock Crew</strong><br />
Redfoo, one of dance music's preeminent talents, has taken over the EDM scene in recent years, both through his solo DJ gigs and as part of the prolific LMFAO duo alongside Sky Blu. A remix of the single "I'm in Miami Bitch" launched the group's initial stardom, while international acclaim came with the David Guetta collaboration "Gettin' Over You," which was subsequently crowned #1 in three countries and peaked in the Top 10 in eight others. LMFAO's second album, Sorry for Party Rocking, continued their success with the release of "Party Rock Anthem" - the single reached the coveted #1 spot in thirteen countries and was the definitive Summer 2011 theme song of soirees worldwide. Currently Redfoo has established himself as a one of the globes preeminent party DJs with a notorious residency at Marquee Las Vegas, LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It" sits at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and iTunes Top 10 Songs charts, and their headlining performance at the American Music Awards has reverberated through pop culture circles around the world in just a few short days. After an epic first performance at LAVO this past August, Redfoo is coming back with his Party Rock Crew for a repeat - the anticipation of his return is building towards epic proportions.</p>
