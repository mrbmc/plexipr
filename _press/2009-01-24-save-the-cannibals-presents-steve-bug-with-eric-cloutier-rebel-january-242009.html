<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>POKER FLAT TURNS 10!</strong><br />
10 years ago an up and coming DJ &amp; Producer named Steve Bug and a close family of DJs and Producers had a vision for something fresh and exciting that would deﬁne the times for a very special new sound. And thus Poker Flat Recordings was born... 10 years on, over 100 singles, and 23 albums later and we have seen the label rise from glorious strength to strength, boasting an international artist roster including the most revered names in the scene. With such artists as Steve Bug, Märtini Brös, Martin Landsky, Phonique, Vincenzo, Guido Schneider, Argy, Trentemøller, Detroit Grand Pubahs, John Tejada, Patrick Chardronnet, Martin Buttrich, Dan Berkson &amp; James What and many, many more, Poker Flat represents the soaring stars of the electronic underground, its Past, Present and Future heroes.</p>
<p>Now on the heels of the anniversary Poker Flat will release a 3 CD anniversary compilation that celebrates all that has been and all that will be, looking back with a gleeful smile over the label‘s decade of music, and of course to the bright future that lies ahead. Across this treasure trove, are exclusive new tracks from key Poker Flat artists, some of the most inﬂuential singles from the current season, and some very special hidden treasures from the back catalogue, selected by the man with the vision that started it all, Steve Bug.</p>
