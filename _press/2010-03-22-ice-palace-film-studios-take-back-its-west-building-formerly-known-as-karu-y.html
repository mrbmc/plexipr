<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ICE PALACE FILM STUDIOS TAKES BACK ITS WEST BUILDING,<br />
FORMERLY KNOWN AS KARU &amp; Y</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> Ice Palace Film Studios</strong>, located at the corner of North Miami Avenue and 14th Street, has just taken back its West Building formerly known as Karu &amp; Y (on the 14th street side of the Ice Palace facility), which will be a special events facility servicing large events.  The entire Ice Palace Facility is on 143,000 square feet of land which  features 20,000 square feet of interior space in its West Building (which was Karu &amp; Y for the last 3 years)  and 65,000 square feet in its East Building (at the North Miami Avenue entrance).  The facility also features  58,000 square feet of gardens and will continue to serve clients ranging from large dinners for corporations and charities to concerts trade shows and of course, the film industry.</p>
<p>Ice Palace Film Studios owner Eugene Rodriguez says, "<em>We feel there is a real need for elegant and flexible spaces where people can produce creative events of all kinds and strive to be an effective resource for South Florida's tourism and advertising industry, as well as the local community which is in dire need of a space of this nature</em>."</p>
<p>The East Building of the Ice Palace, which features the film stages, will be undergoing significant upgrades to be ready for next fall's season.   The Ice Palace Film Studios who's elegant buildings were built in 1923, and were remodeled and opened as the Studio and Event facility in the year 2000, featuring a New Year's Party with 7,000 people entertained by the great Danny Tenaglia and Victor Calderone.  The Ice Palace has just celebrated its ten year anniversary and is now uniting its West Building back under its wing and is looking forward to many more years of serving the South Florida community.</p>
<p>The reintroduction of the West Building (formerly known as Karu &amp; Y), into the Ice Palace facility will now create a more comfortable and expanded layout for the 2010 Winter Music Conference week and all future events to take place at the venue.</p>
