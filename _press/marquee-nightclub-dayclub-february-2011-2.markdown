<p>After an incredible opening month, with resident DJs Erick Morillo breaking in the decks on New Year’s Eve, Kaskade spinning until 8 a.m. after New Year’s Day, and Roger Sanchez, ATB and Chuckie turning up the heat at the city’s newest music destination, Marquee Las Vegas continues into February full of more exclusive 2011 residencies from some of the leading artists in the world, including Sander Van Doorn, Above &amp; Beyond and Markus Schulz. Marquee sets the stage for the ultimate revolutionary clubbing experience, with a state-of-the-art sound system and spectacular visuals complete with custom videos and dancers’ costumes made specially for Marquee’s exquisite DJ residents.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday, February 4 – SANDER VAN DOORN</strong><br />
Sander Van Doorn, recently voted #12 in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs poll, is one of the world’s most sought after DJ and producer. His sets and productions fuse elements of trance, electro, techno and house, uniting the dancefloor under his expertly woven SvD spell. His global touring schedule, remixes for the likes of Robbie Williams, The Killers and Depeche Mode, and headlining appearances at events like Creamfields, Mysteryland and Electric Zoo Festival have cemented his status as a leader in electronic dance music. Number one chart positions on each track released last year, and his immensely popular <em>‘Identity’</em> radio show on Sirius XM, continue to push the superstar’s stock into the stratosphere. His recent ‘Dusk Till Doorn’ compilation album, featuring a mix of progressive house to tech-trance, is now a global clubbing experience that has reached Europe, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East and Africa. This spring, Sander brings this wildly successful clubbing concept to Marquee for its U.S. premiere.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, February 5 – ERICK MORILLO ‘SUBLIMINAL SESSIONS’</strong><br />
Erick Morillo is the owner of <em>Subliminal Records</em> and a platinum-selling artist with a non-stop touring schedule, which includes legendary weekly summer parties at Pacha Ibiza and headline billing at many of the world’s top music festivals. He counts Diddy and Boy George as collaborators, and Naomi Campbell and Marc Anthony as friends. His first dancefloor hit was in 1994 with Reel 2 Real's ubiquitous “I Like To Move It.” Since then, he has developed a funky, soulful house sound, producing more hits like “Break Down The Doors,” “Live Your Life” (with Eddie Thoneick, featuring Shawnee Taylor) and remixes for Whitney Houston and Basement Jaxx, among others. Meanwhile, Subliminal Records continues to sign talented artists and deliver quality releases to the discerning dance music cognoscenti. Erick’s <em>Subliminal Sessions</em> residency at Marquee is a dazzling, Tron-inspired, futuristic experience that breaks all standards of clubbing.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, February 11 – CHUCKIE ‘DIRTY DUTCH RED LIGHT DISTRICT’</strong><br />
Since his discovery in Amsterdam, DJ and producer Chuckie has gained a world-wide following with tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” and “Aftershock.” The addictive <em>Dirty Dutch</em> sound, which he describes as “house with an attitude influenced by hip hop” has grown over the past four years from a solid urban event for 6,000 people into a house music event for over 30,000. With “Let The Bass Kick” supported by the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Laidback Luke, Pete Tong and Sander Kleinenberg, Chuckie has remixed David Guetta and Bob Sinclar, among others. Last year, he landed a multi album artist deal with Atlantic Records in America, has been working with megastars like Jermaine Dupri, P Diddy, Lil Jon, Estelle, Toni Braxton and Akon. His busy touring schedule also includes playing headlining sets at some of the world’s biggest festivals and he recently appeared as a guest DJ on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ show. Chuckie’s Marquee residency, <em>Dirty Dutch Red Light District</em> is a daring, sexy and sophisticated affair.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, February 12 – KASKADE ‘WE &lt;3 KASKADE’ VALENTINE’S SPECIAL</strong><br />
With unmatched versatility in the electronic music world, Kaskade’s epic, soul-lifting music has launched him to international star status. 2010 saw the release of his sixth artist album ‘Dynasty’, which debuted at number 4 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart, as well as the ‘dance.love’ mix compilation. His accolades include the ‘Best Remixer’ Award at the <em>International Dance Music Awards</em>, a spot in DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs, number one iTunes singles and headline billing at major music festivals around the world. His Marquee residency, <em>Color Dream</em>, invites clubbers into a spectacular fantasy world, full of beautiful ballerina dancers and thrilling trance, house and pop music. Kaskade says, <em>"Residencies are really cool because it gives me an opportunity to build something. Typically, I'm just in a city for one night, but I'm going to be here in Vegas every month, refining it and tweaking it. It really lets me indulge artistically and create a show that's going to be special." </em></p>

<p><strong>Friday, February 18 – ROGER SANCHEZ ‘RELEASE YOURSELF’</strong><br />
Grammy award-winning DJ Roger Sanchez’s tremendous 2010 included his 10th summer residency in Ibiza as well as remixes of Maroon 5, OneRepublic and Brandon Flowers, which continue his status as go-to DJ for pop/house hits. Previous remixes for Daft Punk, Diana Ross and No Doubt (which won him a Grammy), contributions to the <em>Blade</em> soundtrack<em>,</em> early hits like “Luv Dancin”, “Another Chance” and “Release Yo Self” and world tours earned the New York native a global audience. He has just released his ‘Release Yourself 10’ compilation, a 10th anniversary of the legendary house music mix series that has grown into an International Dance Music Award-winning podcast and global clubbing concept. Now Roger is currently working on his highly-anticipated artist album which will include several high-profile collaborations, including the recently released dance floor smash “2gether” featuring Far East Movement. For his <em>Release Yourself</em>residency at Marquee, Roger transforms the club into a sexy burlesque boudoir.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, February 19 – ABOVE &amp; BEYOND</strong><br />
At number 5, Above &amp; Beyond are the highest-ranking Brits on DJ Mag’s Top 100 poll. The DJ/production trio finds every possible platform to bring their emotional trance sound to enthusiastic audiences the world over, with sold out shows, instant classics, and their beloved <em>Trance Around the World</em> radio show with over 30 million listeners each week. The group has racked up countless accolades including <em>Essential Mix</em> of the Year, a New Year's performance to over 1 million people, as well as prolific production and remix work for artists both mainstream (most famously Madonna’s “What It Feels Like For A Girl”) and underground. Their <em>Anjunabeats</em> and <em>Anjunadeep</em> labels are widely recognized as a premier platform for forward thinking trance and house. Their current International Dance Music Award nominations include ‘Best European DJ’, 'Best Radio Mix Show DJ', 'Best Artist' (Group), 'Best DJ Mix', and ‘Best Podcast’. With anticipation around their forthcoming Group Therapy album building and lead single "Sun &amp; Moon" recently unveiled, Above &amp; Beyond’s exclusive Las Vegas residency promises to be everything their many fans would hope for – an exclusive showcase of new material and unreleased anthems from their legendary <em>Anjunabeats</em> imprint. Above &amp; Beyond’s exquisite brand of euphoric electronic dance music is sure to lift spirits and feet off the dancefloor at Marquee.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, February 25 – MARKUS SCHULZ</strong><br />
Over the last 10 years, Markus Schulz has fused the individual musical identities of progressive house and trance into his own inimitable sound. His weekly headlining DJ sets in front of many tens of thousands, prominent Global DJ Broadcast radio show listened to by tens of millions, and chart-topping releases on his own <em>Coldharbour Recordings</em> label have revolutionized the U.S. trance scene. In 2008, Schulz punched his way into the Top 10 of DJ Magazine's Top 100 chart and has remained there since. Always prolific, Markus Schulz recently released ‘Prague ‘11,’ a 2-CD compilation reflecting current happenings and his many musical experiences in the Czech Republic. He is also currently nominated for a number of International Dance Music Awards, including ‘Best Global DJ’, ‘Best Radio Mix Show’, and ‘Best Trance Track’ for “Rain.” Schulz’s Marquee residency will cement his love affair with Vegas, building upon last year’s impressive ‘Las Vegas ‘10’ compilation -- a deep and electrifying ode to the <em>“new world clubbing Mecca.”</em> As he says, <em>"what happens in Vegas will no longer stay in Vegas…”</em></p>
