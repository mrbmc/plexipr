<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooklyn, <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1793359834"><span class="aQJ">July 19, 2016</span></span> - Eddie Dean entered in a winning bid of $1.2 million for the purchase of the lease for the premises located at 54 North 11th Street, Brooklyn, NY in U.S. Bankruptcy Court yesterday.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The venue is expected to open in the fall under a new name and vision dedicated to the creative ethos of Brooklyn and serve as an outpost for the global dance music scene. The new space will operate under the direction of Eddie Dean and Director Andrew Inomata, who previously worked with Dean at Pacha NYC and events company RPM Presents, and is anticapted to include a carefully curated team of industry experts.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their collective long-term plan for the venue is to become a creative hub for musicians and artists and tap into the maker-culture of DIY Brooklyn with arts, music, food, and community life. It is anticipated that the venue will continue to host live music concerts and DJ shows, booking globally renowned talent, as well as seek to be an incubator for up and coming talent for all genres of music.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I started my nightlife career in Brooklyn so it’s only fitting that I return here now,” said Dean. “We are excited to take over the North 11th space in this prime location and fully put our nightlife expertise into action.”</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Director Andrew Inomata shared his vision for the new space and said, “We will endeavor to celebrate the spirit of dance music that was born at the crossroads of creativity.”</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eddie Dean returns to his Brooklyn roots with this new venture. He first launched his nightlife career in 1990 with a club called Faces in Bay Ridge and two other Brooklyn hot spots, Ruby’s and Rock ’n Jocks over subsequent years.  After operating nightclub Discotheque / Hush in New York City from 1998-2005, Dean opened the first North American outpost of world renowned clubbing brand Pacha in New York in 2005. The storied club closed in January 2016 after a successful 10 year run. Dean also founded RPM Presents with the late promotional director Rob Fernandez, the dance music marketing and management group continues to operate and has produced over 500 events, including Pier of Fear, Big Week New York, BKWRHS, HYTE Festival, and brought mega-festival Electric Daisy Carnival to New York.</p>
