<p><strong>About Respect</strong><br />
Back in 1996, the Respect trio Jérôme Viger-Kohler, Fred Agostini &amp; David Blot met in Paris and hosted parties at the Queen with the best DJs from Paris touting the new, great French Tour Sound (Daft Punk, Dimitri, Motorbass). With Daft Punk kicking off the opening party, the Respect soirées lasted three years until it went on to conquer the world. From Paris, the Respect party went global; to Tokyo to Caracas, Kuala Lumpur to Sydney, Oslo to Miami, Cannes to Lisbon, with some famous residencies at Vega Copenhagen, Fuse Brussels and of course their legendary sessions at Twilo NYC! In 2002, Respect landed back in Paris on the Seine River for a series of boat parties that lasted four years. The music policy opened itself to all dance enthusiasts from Rock, Techno, Disco, Soul, Funk, Pop, Italo Disco, New Wave, P Funk and GoGo. Why not? Whatever, as long as it is fresh. Now the next chapter is to be written, with 14 weeks ahead to bring Respect back to New York City.</p>
