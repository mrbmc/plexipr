<p>Berlin-based Techno stalwarts, <strong>Minus</strong> return to Miami this year when <strong>Richie Hawtin &amp; guests</strong> take over the outdoor <em>Buddha Gardens</em> at <strong>Karu &amp; Y</strong>, with its flowing river, white tented cabanas and lush greenery. Since 1998, Hawtin’s label has inspired a small family of like-minded artists, DJs, and a new generation of producers to join his side, creating one of the most close-knit collectives in electronic music today. This exclusive event brings the Minus Artists and the Minus sound with its varied and unique mix of minimal and techno, heralding influences from the past with a strong sonic focus on the future. Armed with the newest technology in DJ-ing and live performances, this is a must-see label showcase from the leading luminaries of the Techno scene.</p>
<p><strong>Richie Hawtin</strong> is a name not only synonymous with the word DJ but also with the word technology. No stranger to innovation and creativity, Richie will be headlining his own label imprint’s premiere US event of the year to kick off the 2009 dance music calendar. <strong>Marco Carola</strong> has emerged in the last decade to be one of Italy’s most influential exports of techno and electronic music, now with his own string of releases on Minus sub-label <em>2M</em>, including his latest “The Tribe”. Spaniard <strong>Paco Osuna</strong>, well known for his energetic and carefully crafted DJ sets, will be bringing his effects and laptops to drive the dancefloor into a frenzy. <strong>Troy Pierce</strong> has been on a tirade of clubs all over the world recently  and now emerges with his new full length album, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Autumn</span> under his Louderbach alias. Expect to hear some samplings of the Minus album peppered in his dynamic DJ sets. Canadian transplant <strong>Konrad Black</strong> returns to Miami, after the conclusion of his own U.S. tour for his entry into the Watergate compilation series for the esteemed, eponymous Berlin nightclub. Argentina's <strong>Barem</strong> joins the Minus crew for his U.S. debut. First inspired by a trip to Berlin, his groovy minimal tracks integrate the rhythmic nuances of his native Argentinian roots for a simplistically complex, uniquely funky and heady sound. Both <strong>Gaiser</strong> and <strong>JPLS</strong> are geared up to deliver two distinct and dynamic live sets, with their seamless hardware integration and plug-in wizardry that are sure to set off the crowds to maximal effect.</p>
<p>For a minimal sampling to whet your palette, be sure to check out the latest Minus release, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Midnight Teeth EP</span> by <strong>Bryan Zentz</strong> on <em>Plus 8</em> and subscribe to the new <strong>Minus Podcast</strong> on <em><strong>iTunes</strong></em>.  Each month the Podcast will release an eclectic mix of tracks submitted by Minus artists and friends. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=303957009 ">Subscribe now to Minus Podcast here!</a></p>
