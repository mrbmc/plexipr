<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the return of International DJ/Producer <strong>David Guetta</strong> for a special Thanksgiving weekend extravaganza on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, November 27th, 2009</strong></span>. On the heels of Guetta’s new critically acclaimed album ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Love</span>’ (Astralwerks), Guetta continues to conquer America with his most extensive U.S. tour to date and a triumphant return to NYC to recapture the dancefloor magic.</p>
<p>“<em>I can’t wait to tour in America,</em>” said Guetta.  “<em>I played at the Electric Daisy Carnival in LA and Electric Zoo in NYC this summer and the crowd’s energy was amazing.  There is a real dance culture happening in America right now that I find very exciting.</em>”</p>
<p>Guetta has been on a hot streak since early summer, having produced the Black Eyed Peas record-breaking “I Gotta Feeling” along with the global success of ‘One Love’s’ summer anthem “When Love Takes Over” featuring Kelly Rowland and new monster hit “Sexy Bitch” featuring Akon. ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Love</span>’ has hit #1 across Europe and entered the U.S. iTunes album chart at #12. Guetta was recently named the European ambassador and spokesperson for <em>DJ Hero</em>, further solidifying his stature as one of the world’s biggest DJ’s. This hotly anticipated game on Activision is out now and features 3 ‘One Love’ tracks – “Sexy Bitch,” “When Love Takes Over” and “On the Dancefloor” - in an exclusive download package format.</p>
<p>Guetta released ‘One Love,’ a non-stop, party-thumping musical hybrid of dance beats and hip-hop/R&amp;B vocals to rave reviews in August 2009 to rave reviews.  People Magazine called ‘One Love’ “a party-rocking album” and the Associated Press agreed, “Guetta’s CD is one big party.” The album features vocals from some of music’s biggest names that includes Akon, apl de ap, Estelle, Kid Cudi, Ne-Yo, Novel, Kelly Rowland, Will.I.Am and Chris Willis.</p>
<p>Guetta continues to reach new heights in America.   “When Love Takes Over”  hit the  #1 spot on the Billboard dance chart, reached #28 on the Top 40 airplay chart and #76 on the Billboard Hot 100.   The second single “Sexy Bitch” is currently #1 of the Billboard dance chart, #35 on the Top 40 radio airplay chart, #23 on the Rhythmic radio airplay chart, #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and climbing at a rapid pace.  To date, it has sold nearly 400,000 digital downloads and is currently #21 on the singles chart. The Guetta produced Black Eyed Peas single “I Gotta Feeling” is undoubtedly one of the biggest songs of the year, making the Black Eyed Peas the longest running artist to sit at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p>Guetta shows no signs of slowing down with the announcement of his U.S. 'One Love' tour.   Be on the lookout for the video for his 3rd single “One Love” featuring Grammy® award winner Estelle, another song sure to take over dance floors and radio airwaves around the world.</p>
