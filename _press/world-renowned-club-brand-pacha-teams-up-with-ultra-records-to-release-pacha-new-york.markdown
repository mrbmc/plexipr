<p align="center"><strong><u>World Renowned Club Brand PACHA Teams Up with Ultra Records</u> </strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>To Release 'PACHA NEW YORK' The Pacha nightclub brand has become synonymous with the best in dance music, so it was only a natural step to team up with America's favorite dance music label, Ultra Records. This partnership will bear its first release on November 20th, with legendary NYC nightlife persona and the world's biggest selling DJ: Louie DeVito at the helm as the mixer of the project.</strong></p>
<p>PACHA NEW YORK is a double disc effort that encompasses some of the largest names in the electronic music genre, with surefire dancefloor gems that have been tested and clubber approved.  The star-studded line-up includes The Chemical Brothers, David Guetta, Axwell, Armand Van Helden, Benny Benassi, Tim Deluxe, and Sander Van Doorn.  Inspired by Pacha NYC's legendary club nights, this mix was created to bring the nightclub home to the listener's living room.</p>
<p>Louie DeVito's record for selling albums is one for the record books.  Literally. He placed in the Guinness Record Books for his all-time best-selling DJ mix compilation.  This compilation was his first installation in his fantastically successful New York City Underground Party series (Volumes 1-7) with over 440,000 albums sold to date.</p>
<p>This is Louie's 2nd Pacha CD and his first for the NYC outpost of the famed club brand.  He has toured around Pacha's global venues this past year, and will bring his choice selection of dance hits to the New York venue on November 30th to celebrate the Pacha New York release.</p>
