<em><strong>Made Event presents</strong></em><br />
<strong>SAVE THE CANNIBALS</strong><br />
<strong>Featuring</strong><br />
<strong>MATTHEW DEAR</strong><br />
<strong>Playing an extended 5+ hour set!</strong><br />
<strong>w/ Derek Plaslaiko</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the new techno weekly series – <em><strong>Save The Cannibals</strong></em> at Rebel’s intimate upstairs space with a complete new sound system installed and engineered by Integral Sound.  This week’s installment brings two stalwarts of the scene and while Techno has long been synonymous with Detroit, two of its favorite sons <strong>MATTHEW DEAR</strong> and <strong>DEREK PLASLAIKO</strong>, now call New York their home base. Together they are reunited for a special edition of Stc – Detroit to NYC - on Saturday, February 7th, 2009.</p>
<p>Since Matthew Dear’s first single for Ghostly International - 1999’s "Hands Up For Detroit", both he and the label have become fixtures of the international electronic music scene. His first album, Leave Luck to Heaven appeared in 2003 and was praised widely as a seminal fusion of pop and minimal techno. Dear followed the album with Backstroke in 2004 and his sophomore full length, Asa Breed. He also releases and performs under the harder-edged Audion alias, with a new series of 12"s due out on Spectral in 2009, as well as productions under the False moniker for Minus. Most recently, Matthew’s eagerly-awaited Body Language vol. 7 mix for German’s Get Physical label is a powerful, compelling snapshot of today’s electronic music vanguard, and an intimate journey into the creative heartcore of Matthew himself, shot through with pop panache and a propulsive, party-minded momentum, while also exploring the sensuous side of cutting edge dancefloor music.  Special guest Derek Plaslaiko, also an artist on Spectral Sound, Ghostly’s dancefloor-based offshoot, with his highly acclaimed Spectral Sound Vol. 2 mix CD to celebrate the label’s 50th release.</p>
