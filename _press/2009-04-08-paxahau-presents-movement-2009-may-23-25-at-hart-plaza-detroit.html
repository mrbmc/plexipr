May 23-25, 2009 AT HART PLAZA, DETROIT<br />
<em>THE PRODIGY TO PERFORM AT MOVEMENT OPENING PARTY MAY 22</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Paxahau</strong> is proud to present <strong>Movement 2009</strong> to take place on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 23, 24 and 25, 2009</strong></span> at Hart Plaza in Detroit, MI. Since 2000, Movement has become the ultimate stage for the city that founded techno music to showcase its electronic music muscle.  Last year’s attendance nearly reached 80,000 over three days on Detroit’s Hart Plaza during Memorial Day Weekend, with fans enjoying 36 hours of their favorite electronic music artists and DJs performing on five stages and was named "Festival of the Year" by the readers of URB Magazine.</p>
<p>“<em>Every year our goal is to build upon the success of the previous year by bringing the best available local, national and international talent to Detroit in order to create a weekend experience unlike any other in the World</em>,” said Jason Huvaere, president of Paxahau.  “<em>Our team spends a lot of time selecting artist and DJs that will appeal to electronic music enthusiasts.  This year there will be a major Detroit presence at the festival as well as some performers that rarely set foot on stage in the United States.”<br />
