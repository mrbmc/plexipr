<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents the official New York City stop of the <strong>Rebel Rave Tour</strong> featuring <strong>Damian Lazarus</strong>, <strong>Jamie Jones</strong>, <strong>Seth Troxler</strong>, <strong>Deniz Kurtel</strong>, and opening set by <em>Blk|Market Membership</em>'s <strong>Taimur+Fahad</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, February 12, 2010.</strong></span></p>
<p>The ultimate collection of musical oddballs and misfits known as the <strong>Rebel Rave Crew</strong> have been responsible for some of the most exciting sounds in recent dance music, both behind the decks and as cutting edge producers. Now, the Rebel Ravers will lead club goers at New York megaclub Pacha NYC on a musical odyssey, displaying their unique twist on the electronic scene.  Starting with <em>Crosstown Rebels</em> head and underground DJ hero <strong>Damian Lazarus</strong>, who has been on quite a roll recently.  His recent debut artist album<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Smoke The Monster Out</span> was met with critical acclaim and is set to release its third single “Diamond in the Dark”.</p>
<p>As the mastermind of the tour he states, "<em>The Rebel Rave tour is a great opportunity for all the Rebel family to gather together for awesome parties at some of the best clubs in the world. We bring a special sense of fun to the dancefloor, our combined sound is second to none and our followers across America know to expect the unexpected. Get ready to Rave</em>"  Playing alongside Damian will be a slew of today’s most forward thinking underground artists.  <strong>Jamie Jones</strong> has quickly risen through the ranks and become a figure that simply cannot be ignored.  His anthem ‘Summertime” became one of the biggest tracks of the year and was recently named DJ Mag’s “Best Single of 2009”.  Jamie also received the magazines honor as the year’s “Best Producer”.  Having recently been named #8 in Resident Advisor’s Best DJs of 2009 Poll, <strong>Seth Troxler</strong> has rapidly gained notoriety throughout the scene.  From Detroit to Berlin and everywhere in between, Seth has made a name for himself playing some of the most unique sets in the business, while noticeably enjoying every minute he steps behind the decks. His next move for world domination is an unsurprisingly excellent compilation for <em>BPitch</em>'s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Boogybytes Vol. 5</strong></span>. Turkish born <strong>Deniz Kurtel</strong> is set to unveil her debut live performance alongside a self-made LED lighting system.  Already being hailed as the next great hope for electronic music, her debut single ‘Yeah’ has been called an all time classic.  Rounding out the bill will be NYC favorites <strong>Taimur + Fahad</strong>.  Their infamous <em>Blk|Market Membership</em> events have brought some of techno’s finest talents to various secret venues throughout the city.  As DJ’s they present a sound perfect for starting this music journey on the right note.  New York mega club <em>Pacha NYC</em> has seen its share of talent in its 4+ years, but The Rebel Rave crew is sure to provide the venue with a night unlike any other.</p>
