<p style="text-align: justify;">On <strong>Friday, September 16<sup>th</sup></strong> at 6pm EDT <strong>Dubspot</strong> will welcome <strong>Mad Professor</strong> to their New York City home for a discussion of dub, dubstep, the links and history of the two genres and his own personal production and performance strategies. Like all of Dubspot’s workshops, worldwide access is available via live streaming on the <a href="http://t.ymlp161.com/uejueacauejwadajsjaraqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Dubspot Blog</a>. To attend in person, <a href="http://t.ymlp161.com/uejumadauejwagajsjaiaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">please RSVP</a>. Space is extremely limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mad Professor, London-based founder of Ariwa Sounds, is bringing his years of experience in the reggae roots of dub, expanding across numerous musical genres and sharing his insights into live performance and mixing. There is arguably no DJ with more skill or authority in dub and its countless forms than Mad Professor, nor another musician who stays more true to the roots of these genres. Without dub, there is no dubstep. Laying the foundation for one of today’s most popular and exciting areas of music, he not only saw this genre’s origin, but has been an active contributor to its ongoing evolution. See him contextualize and present dubstep’s key role in the present-day electronic music digital age. Using an analog mixing board combined with some newer digital effects, Mad Professor will demonstrate live dub and speak about his forthcoming  “Roots Of Dubstep” project on his own label, Ariwa Sounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mad Professor will be playing later that night as part of <a href="http://t.ymlp161.com/uejujatauejwatajsjaaaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Dub Invasion Festival</a>, with Twilight Circus Dub and Majestic Twinsound at The Knitting Factory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dubspot’s revolutionary workshop series has hosted an abundance of world class artists in the past, including Kate Simko, Soul Clap, Percussivo Mundo Novo, DJ Irie and King Britt &amp; Rucyl. Spanning all aspects of music production and performance, genres, styles and tastes, the workshops allow established musicians to highlight their roots, their influences and their personal strategies that have led to their success.</p>
