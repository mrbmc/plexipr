<p>Armin van Buuren celebrates 10 years with an exclusive 6 hour sunset set outside on the Pawn Shop terrace. Spinning from a retrofitted double-decker bus, Armin\'s unique style of melodic, progressive trance will make for a truly magical Miami experience. His latest album \'10 Years\' (Armada Music/Ultra Records) is a retrospective of his biggest tracks, trance classics and previously unreleased material from the last decade - a must for every trance music collection.   </p>
<p>Armin\'s hugely popular radio show \"A State of Trance\" has just been picked up by the UK\'s KISS-FM and can now be heard in 20 countries by 2.5 million people every week. Meanwhile, Armin continues to play gigs and festivals the whole world over, including a memorable 2-day gig with Made Event underneath the Brooklyn Bridge overlooking Manhattan in summer 2006. Stay tuned for summer 2007!    </p>
