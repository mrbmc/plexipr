<p><strong>Thursday, February 10 – CHUCKIE</strong><br />
Chuckie’s addictive Dirty Dutch sound, which he describes as “house with an attitude influenced by hip hop,” has grown over the past four years into a worldwide clubbing concept -- and earned him a global following. With mind-bending climaxes, surprise effects and explosive beats (as heard in hit tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” and “Aftershock”) Chuckie has been dubbed “The King of Mixing,” gaining support from the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Pete Tong and David Guetta. Among other accolades, he recently won the TMF ‘Best Dance DJ’ award where he beat off competition from fellow Dutch heavyweights Tiesto and Armin Van Buuren. Chuckie’s busy touring schedule also includes playing headlining sets at some of the world’s biggest festivals and has recently signed on as host on the legendary BBC Radio 1’s ‘In New DJs We Trust’ weekly show.</p>

<p><strong>Friday, February 18 – MARTIN SOLVEIG</strong><br />
Frenchman Martin Solveig has been synonymous with forward-thinking electronic music for over a decade. As the head manager of the Mixture Stereophonic records label, he has established himself as an electro-pop icon. His video for “<a href="http://t.ymlp25.net/yuhjagamybacajesanaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Boys &amp; Girls (feat. Dragonette)</a>” -- which was shot at Jean-Paul Gaultier’s ‘Maison de Couture’ after a chance meeting with the designer revealed a mutual admiration -- went on to amass over three million hits on <a href="http://t.ymlp25.net/yuhjagamybacajesanaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. The masterful, Strokes-inspired tracks on Martin’s 2008 album ‘C’est la Vie’ took the airwaves by storm and resulted in the ‘C’est la Vie Remixes’ album featuring Laidback Luke, the Bloody Beetroots and Fedde Le Grand, as well as weekly radio show called "C'est La Vie" on stations worldwide. Martin’s current track “Hello (feat. Dragonette)” was a breakthrough summertime smash and is featured in the first episode of his new <a href="http://t.ymlp25.net/yuhbalamybalajesavaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">“SMASH” webseries</a>, which has been viewed by 4 million people and counting. “Hello” also introduces Martin’s fifth studio album, ‘Smash,’ due out this year.

<p><strong>Thursday, February 24 – TATIANA FONTES</strong><br />
Tatiana Fontes returns to wow the crowd with her fusion of the ‘80s and rock from her youth (Duran Duran, The Cure, and the like), along with European house and electronic music, drawn from her years working as an international model. The Brazilian-born DJ grew up in the music business, with a father who owned a nightclub and brothers who were professional DJs. Though she traveled the globe to places like Paris, Milan and Japan to do major campaigns, editorials and fashion shows, and was cast in Oliver Stone’s Any Given Sunday as well as a 2005 Pepsi campaign alongside Eva Longoria, Tatiana longed to return to her true passion of music. Now residing in Los Angeles, Tatiana DJs regularly at the hottest clubs and parties around the world.</p>
