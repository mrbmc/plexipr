<p><strong>Danny Howells</strong> is one of the few DJs on the scene today that truly has a style of his own. With his passion for all styles of music and infectious personality, Danny has created a unique, eclectic sound that has established him as one of the top DJs in the world. This year, Danny has taken time out of his hectic DJ schedule to combine his vast experience and imperative creative vision to bring us his new, vibrant and forward thinking Dig Deeper imprint.</p>
<p>The label has been specifically designed to showcase Danny’s inspiring new productions and reflect his legendary DJ sets. Danny explains… “<em>I'd wanted to start a label for years, but waited until a time when I felt I could put 100% into it. It was only last year when I realized I was producing at a much higher rate than before, that I knew the time was right.</em>"<br />
<em><br />
"The Dig Deeper nights have been going for a long time now, and in a perfect situation it gives me the chance to really delve into the different genres that appeal to me, and it's that range of music that I want the label to explore. I think that among the releases there will be something for everyone. There's been such great support so far, and that only makes me want to put out better and better releases.</em>”</p>
<p>The labels premier release “September” featuring a Future Beat Alliance remix was extremely significant as it did not only launch the label but it was Danny’s first major output for over five years. The release gained huge support from the likes of DJ luminaries such as Ben Watt, who called it “<em>a proper DJ’s record</em>”; Laurent Garnier, Dubfire and Joris Voorn.</p>
<p>Danny’s second release “Right Off”, a chuggy fusion of deep-disco house with 80s overlays, was a seriously hypnotic track and was lapped up by the likes of Kissy Sell Out, DJ Hell, Justin Robertson and Ashley Beedle. The Faze Action remix complemented this release perfectly and was a great addition to the label.</p>
<p>Danny’s third offering was the eagerly anticipated deep house groover “The Shining”. The original first saw the light of day on Danny’s illustrious Renaissance mix CD which was one of Renaissance’s highest selling albums of 2008! This tidy single package featured a couple of amazing remixes from Stryke and was played by Desyn Massielo, Nick Warren and ATFC.</p>
<p>Danny’s fourth release, “Flight Home”, which includes a drum n bass remix from Matrix. The original is a lovely down-tempo number with sophisticated ambient sounds; but for those who like their music a little grittier, the Matrix mix really steps up to the plate. A dirty bassline and orchestral overlays transport this beautiful track to the dark, sweaty dancefloors and was greatly received by the likes of Nu Tone, Danny Bird and Blame.</p>
<p>Danny’s most recent fifth release is the impressive, “Laid Back/Breaks”. The EP’s lead track “Laid Back” oozes class with a smooth funk driven bassline, hypnotic chord stabs and a dreamy melodic leadline. Tom Budden heads up a solid re-rub and a Flat Out Drum Edit is included for all of those who like it stripped back just to the essentials. “Breaks” completes this comprehensive release which has gained glowing praise from the likes of Jody Wisternoff, Hernan Cattaneo and Gabriel Ananda.</p>
<p>With every release offering something slightly different and packaged in colourful eye catching imagery, Danny has created an outlet which displays his versatility and character to stand-out from the crowd and compliment his infamous Dig Deeper philosophy.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to come from Danny Howells, so come with us as he Digs Deeper for the ultimate summer closing party. See you on the beach!</p>
