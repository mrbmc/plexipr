<em>Made Event &amp; Armani Exchange present</em><br />
A new experience in extraordinary sound and vision<br />
FERRY CORSTEN<br />
JOHN DAHLBÄCK<br />
@ Nokia Theatre</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>Armani Exchange</strong></em> proudly present the launch of a new series of electronic music events at the famous <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong>. The inaugural party brings Dutch dance music pioneer and perennial DJ Mag Top 10 DJ <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong>, along with Swedish electro house wonder<strong> John Dahlbäck</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, February 12, 2010</strong></span>.</p>
<p>It's easy to get excessive when talking about DJs, but with dance music veteran and trance hero <strong>Ferry Corsten</strong>, the facts speak for themselves.  The accolades and awards he has received for his productions, remixes, and DJ skills have resulted in Ferry being voted as one of the Top 10 DJs in the world by DJ Magazine for almost a decade. Since his immersion on the scene, the Dutch musician has amassed best-selling albums and nearly a dozen gold singles.  He also maintains a worldwide tour schedule which, on any given weekend, brings him to all corners of the globe.  His albums, remixes, and singles reach iconic status almost immediately upon release as such iconic tracks as "Made of Love", "Punk", "Gouryella", and "Out of the Blue" can prove.  Ferry shows no signs of slowing down in 2010. His 2001 System F album <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Out of the Blue</strong></span> will be re released and digitally re-mastered featuring the complete track list and some hard to find remixes.  Also, the release of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Out of the Blue 2010</strong></span>, which features the legendary trance anthem remixed by some of today’s top artists including Tiesto, Laidback Luke, and Giuseppe Ottaviani, amongst a slew of others.  In spring 2010, Ferry is also set to launch a brand new compilation series entitled “<em>Once Upon A Night</em>”, as well as its accompanying concert experience. All the while, Ferry's "<em>Corsten's Countdown</em>" show is broadcast on Sirius XM Radio weekly on Wednesdays at 9pm ET.</p>
<p>The name <strong>John Dahlbäck</strong> is not only for the underground people, but for everyone, everywhere.  He is the lucky father of the label <em>Pickadoll</em>, which has featured releases from some of the finest producers working today.  Though John may be considered a youngster by some standards, his age within the realm of dance music is anything but.  Boasting a discography that borders one hundred, including his most recent chart topper "<em>Love Inside</em>", John has solidified his place amongst the hardest working and most respected DJ’s and producers.  Having come from a family rich in musical tradition, which includes cousin Jesper, John Dahlbäck has carved out his own signature sound in relatively minimal time.  A sound grounded in electro and borrowing elements throughout the dance music spectrum has made John one of Beatport’s most downloaded artists of recent years.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> is an indoor theater designed by award-winning architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group. The 2,100-capacity venue has an expansive dancefloor with staggered tiers providing unobstructed views, combined with comfy stadium seating in the rear and a chic lounge area.</p>
