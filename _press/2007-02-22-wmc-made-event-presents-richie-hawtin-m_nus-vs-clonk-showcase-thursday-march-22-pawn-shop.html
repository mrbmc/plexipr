<p>This Winter Music Conference, Richie Hawtinï¿½s pioneering electronic music label MINUS will be showcasing its talent of like-minded electronic artists for the future generation at boutique nightclub Pawn Shop. In an incredibly successful 2006, Minus was named Label of the Year in German magazine Groove and was voted the #1 Top Label of the year by ResidentAdvisor.net, the latter stating, <i>The output of M_nus has been undeniably strong this year: Loco Dice Seeing Through Shadows, Heartthrob Baby Kate, Gaiser Egress, Troy Pierce 25 Bitches, Marc Houle Bay of Figs -  almost everything the label has touched has turned to gold. Whether you think the Emperor\'s clothes are too minimal or not, the rise of the M-genre has undeniably been the biggest club phenomenon of the year, and genre-definers M_nus rightfully snag our top prize.</i></p>
<p>In 2007 the label will be gearing up with new releases by Heartthrob, Ambivalent, JPLS, False, Gaiser, Magda, a compilation of Minus classics and in exciting news, rumored new Hawtin material.</p>
<p>On the label front, Richie Hawtin\'s pioneering electronic labels Minus and Plus 8 have announced an internal restructuring with the appointment of Seth Hodder (ex-Mute/NovaMute) as General Manager, who will be based at the Minus office in Berlin. Clark Warner will continue as Label Manager heading the office in Windsor, Ontario, Canada for an interim period.</p>
<p>Minus was started in 1998 by Richie Hawtin originally as an outlet for his own musical experiments and endeavors. Over the past eight years Minus has grown into a globally recognized imprint representing the best in underground electronic music for dancing machines.</p>
<p>Owner & President Richie Hawtin comments, <i>as Acting Label Manager, Clark has been an invaluable member of the Minus family, and with his help and dedication over the years, Minus has grown into a strong presence within the electronic music community. Seth brings a wealth of experience and knowledge with him from his years at Mute/NovaMute, and can help us move into new territories and further develop our artists. This is an important step for the development of Minus and for all of our future plans.</i></p>
<p>The Minus website m-nus.com has just relaunched with a new site and logo.</p>
