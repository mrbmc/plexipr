OVERBOARD BOAT PARTY<br />
(Preschool)<br />
STEVE BUG // ADULTNAPPER</strong></p>
<p>As the summer season reaches its peak, <strong>Matter/:Form</strong> and <strong>Made Event</strong> are gearing up to launch the<em> Sunday</em> <em>School For Degenerates</em> weekend with a special edition of the <em>Overboard Boat Party</em> on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Sunday, August 31st</strong></span> with first class Degenerates <strong>Steve Bug &amp; Adultnapper</strong>.</p>
<p>The Bug is back. Following his third Sunday School for Degenerates appearance at this year’s past Winter Music Conference, Poker Flat Recordings label head <strong>Steve Bug</strong> comes to New York for the inaugural edition of Sunday School for Degenerates in NYC.  Now, this proven Degenerate is about to release his newest mix compilation titled “Bugnology 3,” following from the pioneering and heralded 'Bugnology' mix in 2004, and the equally outstanding 'Bugnology 2' in 2006. The mix presents a detailed, mesmerizing journey through Bug's current musical addiction and also takes a snapshot of a very exciting time in dance music - where genres and barriers are continually being broken, in the name of exciting, forward thinking and free-flowing house music.</p>
<p>NYC’s arch tech selector <strong>Adultnapper</strong> is set to release the next installment of Steve Bug’s Audiomatique imprint with its second label compilation, Audiomatique Volume 2.0. The album is a descent into the deepest realms of electronic rhythm, veering from the spare crisp minimalism of Gui Boratto and Martin Eyerer’s ‘The Beach’, to the moody, strobe lit melancholy of Minus producer Gaiser’s ‘Found Guilty Mix’ of Adultnapper’s own ‘Juror no. 9’. A perfect snapshot of the label’s diverse roster, Adultnapper subtly builds the mix from stripped back, echoic grooves to tougher club battering technoid epics. It’s Adultnapper‘s mix that illustrates the electronic zeitgeist of the moment and offers a glimpse of where house and techno are heading in the future.</p>
<p>The Overboard Boat Party will also feature a tour of New York City's Public Art Project "WATERFALLS" by the celebrated artist Olafur Eliasson. Get up-close at the cascading splendor of the breathtaking waterfall scenes as well as the Manhattan skyline, the Brooklyn Bridge, Governor's Island, Ellis Island, and the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Come sail away for this “prerequisite” party to embark on a full-on degenerate weekend. The degeneration continues the same night at the Sunday School for Degenerates party at Rebel and concludes at Monday’s Afterschool Special at The Yard.</p>
