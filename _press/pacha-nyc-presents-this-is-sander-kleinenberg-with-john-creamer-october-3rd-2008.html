JOHN CREAMER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pacha NYC</strong> presents one of its favorite sons <strong>SANDER KLEINENBERG </strong>on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, October 3rd, 2008</strong></span>. After a very successful summer season as resident of the Pure Pacha nights in Ibiza, Sander closes out the season and returns to Pacha NYC armed with an arsenal of hot new tracks and custom DVDs.</p>
<p>Pure Pacha Ibiza has recorded one of its busiest seasons to date with Sander stepping up gloriously to the task of becoming the clubs main resident for 2008. Basement Jaxx, Faithless, Paul Oakenfold and The Swedish House Mafia have all made appearances so far at one of the island's wildest parties. Be sure to catch one of Sander's final date at the Pure Pacha Ibiza closing party on 26th September alongside Axwell and Trevor Nelson.</p>
<p>Pacha NYC is proud to welcome back dance music's original Dutch king, Sander Kleinenberg. As one of Global Underground's original "Nu Breed" crew, Sander's become only more exciting since launching his own "This Is" party brand, and branching out his sound from the progressive trance of "My Lexicon" to the electro-filth of "The Fruit" to Winter Music Conference anthem "This Is Miami." After being locked down in the studio working on brand new material for most of the summer, Sander is sure to destroy the dancefloor. After all, This is New York!Â  Unmissable.</p>
