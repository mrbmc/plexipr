Le Jean De presents<br />
ETE D’AMOUR<br />
ALAN BRAXE<br />
33HZ live</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">French disco electro house pioneer <strong>Alan Braxe </strong>touches down with <strong>33Hz</strong> performing live at <strong>Ete d’Amour - Santos</strong> <strong>Party House</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, August 28th</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Ever since Braxe’s first "Vertigo” track was released in 1997on Thomas Bangalter’s emblematic Roulé label, he has went on to release hits as big as “Music Sound Better With You” (Stardust) and “Intro” (in collaboration with Fred Falke). Since then his numerous remixes includes work for artistes as varied as; Björk, Britney Spears, Annie, Kylie Minogue, Goldfrapp, Kelis, Jamiroquai and more recently, Justice. His label Vulture enabled him to experiment new paths as he did with “Rubicon” (co-written with Fred Falke), “In Love With You” (The Paradise) or as he did with his last single - “Addicted” – which was included on the Kitsuné Maison 5th compilation released earlier this year. Vulture also enables him to produce artists, notably Lifelike and Kris Menace. After numerous years of studio work, Alan Braxe now performs as a DJ throughout the world and he is rediscovering the ambiance of clubs which made him fall in love with electronic music in the first place.</p>
<p>Over 10 years ago, the members of New York City's 33Hz dusted off their love of late-era disco at exactly the right moment. Back then, the band re-energized a genre long dormant, spiking it for dance-hungry Manhattan scenesters with modish dashes of electronica, blue-eyed soul, silky R&amp;B, and early-era rap. Fast forward to their full-length debut in 2005, 33Hz refined its sound, producing electro-fried soul  and added no wave and new wave elements that lend themselves today to spontaneous dancing and explosive action on the dancefloor.</p>
<p>The one and only Respect party is back in New York with its club festival ÉTÉ D'AMOUR, to celebrate the summer! Expect a twist of legendary DJs, fresh sounds, new sensations, billions of flirts and lots of romance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ÉTÉ D’AMOUR est arrivé! The Summer of Love has arrived! After a 7-year absence, the transatlantic Parisian Respect party returns to New York City. A long overdue comeback to the NYC nightlife landscape, Respect unites with Le Jean De and first-class promoters Made Event for a sizzling summer series destined to reclaim downtown nightlife for NYC’s own ÉTÉ D’AMOUR.</p>
