<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>July 19 - Hardwell</strong><br />
At just 23 years old, Hardwell is in the DJ Mag Top 100, a label owner, and has staked his spot as a world-renowned producer. With already 10 years in the business, he cut his chops at a very young age, and was signed to a Dutch record label when he was just 14. Shortly after he started to play all the major clubs in The Netherlands. His signature "big room house" style has produced the anthems "Spaceman," "Cobra," "Three Triangles" and "The World," along with his renowned bootleg "Show Me Love vs. Be," an epic combo of Steve Angello and Laidback Luke's track and Robin S's classic. Hardwell has also remixed a who's who list of top-notch producers, including Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Martin Solveig, Akon, Taio Cruz, Fedde Le Grand and more. 2012 has been a big year for Hardwell, and has included a set at Electric Daisy Carnival in Vegas, which he described in a recent <a href="http://t.ymlp328.net/uhjsbanajqsuazauhaaaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">interview with MTV News</a>. His latest big single "Kontiki," composed along with Dannic, is a big time progressive/electro house track that has been heard around the world, the track "How We Do" featuring Showtek has a dope <a href="http://t.ymlp328.net/uhjshadajqsuacauhakaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">new music video</a>, and his new mix  Revealed, Vol. 3, was just released earlier this month, and has tracks from Tiesto, Wolfgang Gartner, Knife Party,Tommy Trash, Laidback Luke, Chuckie, Dada Life, Nicky Romero, Dannic, Jordy Dazz and Dyro. Be sure to check him out at LAVO when he takes over the decks on July 19.</p>
