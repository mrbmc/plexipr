Made Event presents<br />
SANDER VAN DOORN<br />
'Supernaturalistic' Global Album Tour<br />
With Jason Jollins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Event</strong> presents the IDMA's Best Breakthrough Artist <strong>Sander van Doorn</strong> on his debut artist album <em>'Supernaturalistic'</em> tour at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, April 25th.</strong></span></p>
<p>In just two short years, dance music's hottest burgeoning talent, <strong>Sander van Doorn</strong> has debuted in DJ Mag's prestigious Top 100 poll at #32 in 2006, then climbed to #15 in 2007. After a series of successful parties at the Winter Music Conference, Van Doorn triumphantly returns to the U.S. with his recently awarded title of 'Best Breakthrough Artist' from the International Dance Music Awards.</p>
<p>Now on the heels of the release of his debut artist album and first U.S. release 'Supernaturalistic', Sander continues to dominate with 12 new, original tracks on this well thought-out and flawlessly delivered assortment of music. The roots of Sander's first excursion into artist album territory are both subtly and overtly embedded in trance, following his recent hot streak of dancefloor hits, "Riff," "Grasshopper" and "By Any Demand." For a special bonus track on the album, Sander Van Doorn gives London's pop-songstress Sia a dancefloor makeover with his electrifying remix of "Sia: The Girl You Lost To Cocaine."</p>
<p><em>Sander van Doorn's debut artist album 'Supernaturalistic' is out now on Ultra Records.</em></p>
