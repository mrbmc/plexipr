**House of Yes**, Brooklyn’s favorite eclectic nightlife venue and weekend brunch haven described by [amNY](http://t.ymlp71.com/jyhmhakaebswwacahuqakaueqwe/click.php) as “a magical Bushwick space that merges, aerialists, dance and brunch”, welcomes Risky Business back to their daytime dancefloor for a super special [FREE with RSVP NO PANTS ](http://t.ymlp71.com/jyhmbazaebswwarahuqaxaueqwe/click.php)brunch party from 11am-6pm this Sunday, March 12.

Revellers can ditch their pants at the House of Yes pants check and dance in their most outrageous underwear bottoms in between $20 unlimited mimosas (max 1 hour) and chowing down on delicious a la carte brunch items like the infamous House of Yes shakshuka eggs, malawach (eggs with Yemenite puff pastry), or Middle Eastern plate. A pants off dance off competition will take place for the chance to win a brunch for two at House of Yes at a later date. Go-go dancers and a glitter boy will have the party vibes cranking whilst keeping no pants diners entertained throughout their meal.

Known for their signature tech house sound, the Risky Business collective welcomes Mexico City’s Moose & Bear, who have previously shared the stage with heavyweights such as Gorgon City, John Digweed and The Martinez Brothers, to bring their booty-shaking beats to the House of Yes main room. Risky Business resident Aiden Jude will be joined alongside local New York favorites Nimo Iero, and Alex Raouf making this pants off, dance off brunch party the perfect way to do Sunday right and finish out the weekend in pantsless style.

Brunch table reservations are available for groups of 6 or more by email: brunch@houseofyes.org.

About House of Yes:\
House of Yes opened its third iteration in Bushwick at the beginning of 2016 to become a beacon of NYC nightlife after shuttering its doors too soon in East Williamsburg three years ago. Original partners Anya Sapozhnikova and Kae Burke, teamed up with Ilan Telmont and Justin Ahiyon to build out the best venue ever with a little help from their friends, seeding a Kickstarter campaign for $92,340 (original goal: $60,000). The space includes an art-deco restaurant parlor, a spectacularly decorated warehouse-sized performance space, a courtyard with kitschy repurposed decor, and a clandestine mini-club. House of Yes is now the home of circus spectacles, immersive cinema, burlesque and cabaret shows, aerial extravaganzas, nightlife parties, morning raves, brunch, BBQs, and bubble baths, all with superior sound and exemplary service. Each night is specially curated to create an immersive experience with music, theatrics, and performances to titillate the senses and expand your mind, unlike any other venue in Brooklyn right now.
