GARETH EMERY + BLAKE JARRELL + RANK 1 @ Nightclub</strong><br />
After releasing his first album “Northern Lights” in 2010, scoring the number one spot on US iTunes within hours of its debut, Gareth Emery continues his onslaught with an award-winning podcast of more than 100 episodes over the last four years, recently releasing the official remix of Britney Spears’ newest single, “I Wanna Go,” and his own album featuring Lucy Saunders, “Fight the Sunrise” out last May. His “Maldives (Original Mix)” is set for release this month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emery is joined by Chicago-native Blake Jarrell, whose own monthly “Concentrate Podcast” features signature mix sets and special international guests. With a schedule that sees him flying between Ibiza, Dubai, Singapore and Los Angeles, he continually releases new original music and remixes, some of which will premiere this month at Marquee Las Vegas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also joining the lineup is Rank 1. Formed in the Netherlands in 1997, Rank 1 is widely regarded as one of the originators of the Dutch trance sound. Their biggest hit is the 1999 track "Airwave", which reached #25 in the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. The duo’s tracks "L.E.D. There Be Light" and “Symfo” have been chosen to represent a number of music festivals worldwide.</p>

ERICK MORILLO with Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano @ Nightclub</strong><br />
A regular in the Top 5 on Beatport, Erick Morillo’s newly released single “Stronger” featuring Eddie Thoneick and Shawnee Taylor from his 2010 album, ‘Live Your Life,’ promises to soundtrack the summer. After launching his own label Subliminal in 1997, Morillo now has a regular Sessions Podcast, while continuing to fill dance floors worldwide. <strong> </strong>Known especially for his Subliminal Sessions residency in Ibiza every summer, Morillo faithfully returns to Vegas for <em>Subliminal Sessions</em> at Marquee -- a futuristic affair featuring spectacular custom videos and glow-in-the-dark costumed dancers.

When not performing all over the globe, they can be found in their Amsterdam studio coming up with one dancefloor destroyer after another. Their 2008 debut tracks include “Pina” and “Lift U Up feat. Reese &amp; Chappell,” after which Steve Angello scooped up “Traffic” and “Snitch” for release on his Size Records label.

After making waves at the pool party attended by guests like Nicole Scherzinger last month, Marquee resident and Grammy award-winning DJ Roger Sanchez returns for his <em>Release Yourself</em> residency, transforming the club into a sexy burlesque boudoir. Sanchez continues to add to his collection of dancefloor anthems with the release of his newest track "Worldwide" featuring Mobin Master and MC Flipside and has now also unveiled a set of banging remixes from Bobby Burns, Adrian Lux &amp; Blende, Santos and Coucheron, all of which can be previewed on his <a href="http://t.ymlp136.net/uusymakaqqwapabmafaqeuh/click.php" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>. Sanchez’s status as the go-to DJ for pop/house hits is evidenced by his remixes of Maroon 5, OneRepublic Daft Punk, Diana Ross and No Doubt (which won him a Grammy). Out soon is his newest ‘Release Yourself’ compilation, a legendary house music mix series that has grown into an International Dance Music Award-winning podcast and global clubbing concept.

RANDY BOYER @ Dayclub</strong><br />
With an infectious energy behind the decks and a niche for producing some of the world's most explosive progressive and electro-trance tunes, Randy Boyer is one of the most established and sought-after DJs and producers in the United States. Outfitted with his own production studio, Boyer has carved himself a permanent position in the electronic dance music scene with numerous chart topping singles for music moguls at Ultra, Armada Music, Flashover, Vandit, Coldharbour, A State of Trance, Def Jam, Arista and Warner Brothers. In addition to his impressive DJ career, Boyer also joined forces with the late Eric Tadla and created the legendary duo EnMass, whose ground breaking production, "CQ (Seek You)" was dubbed by Armin van Buuren himself as "one of his favorite trance classics ever made." A true veteran of the game, Boyer is also the co-owner of EnMass Music, a brand new record label he launched with his good friend and industry partner, Darude.</p>

SEBASTIAN INGROSSO + BT @ Nightclub</strong><br />
A member of the infamous Swedish House Mafia with Axwell and Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso is responsible (along with Dirty South and David Guetta) for “How Soon Is Now,” which has become a modern day vocal house classic. His additional hit tracks include “Leave The World Behind,” an amazing re-edit of “Swimming Places” from Julian Jabre on Defected, a searing remix of “Jack You” with Steve Angello for Diddy and Felix (which was approved by Sean Combs himself) and many more. Last year Ingrosso co-wrote and co-produced “Cupid Boy,” one of the key electronic anthems on Kylie Minogues’s new number 1 album, further establishing his position as one of the world’s biggest dance music masters. Just recently, Swedish House Mafia debuted their epic remix of Coldplays’ new single “Every Teardrop is Waterfull,” which became an instant mega hit. After the amazing achievements of the past few years, Ingrosso’s ambition and talent show no signs of abating. He is joined at Nightclub by BT.</p>

CHRIS LAKE @ Dayclub</strong><br />
In the last five years, Chris Lake has traveled the globe as a DJ and topped industry charts numerous times as a producer, all while chasing down the freshest beats around as a music lover.
