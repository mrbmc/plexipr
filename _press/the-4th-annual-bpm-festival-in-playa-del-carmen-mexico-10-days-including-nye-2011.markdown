<p>After a record-breaking turnout in 2010, with over 18,000 people in attendance, <strong>The BPM Festival</strong> is returning to <strong>Playa del Carmen, Mexico</strong> for its 4th year of world-class DJs and parties on the sunny shores of the Mayan Riviera.

The BPM Festival is now pleased to announce the official 2011 dates: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>December 31st, 2010 – January 9th, 2011</strong></span>.</p>

<p>In its few short years of existence, The BPM Festival has continued to expand and grow year after year, pushing its own boundaries, and constantly challenging itself to provide a world-class electronic music experience in one of the most spectacular beach locations on the planet. Originally designed as an elite industry-networking event, the festival has morphed into an international mélange of electronic music lovers, DJs, producers, revelers and partygoers, all united to escape the winter doldrums and holiday in the sun. Beautiful outdoor and indoor venues are spread around the resort town of Playa del Carmen, hosting parties day and night, along with a wide selection of the world's finest DJs. 2010’s edition saw over 70 artists from around the globe take to the decks and this year promises to be even bigger, with more day parties and night parties to choose from on any given night, and with the addition of New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Playa del Carmen is an idyllic, beautiful Mexican resort town, tucked into the coastline of the Mayan peninsula, 45 minutes south of the tourist haven Cancun. White sand beaches, turquoise waters, wonderful food, and lots—and lots—of sunshine await those who make the trip.</p>
<p>Partnerships for this year’s BPM Festival include Beatport Beach Party, Space Beach Party (Miami), Playhouse LA Beach Party (LA), and Bal en Blanc White Party (Montreal). The many venues participating in BPM Festival—including Blue Parrot, Brahma, La Santanera, Kool Beach, Alux Cave and Blue Cacao Beach Club and more—will provide a different setting each night in this Mexican Caribbean paradise.</p>
<p>A limited amount of PRE-SALE specially priced VIP 10-DAY PASSES will be on sale beginning <span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 20th, 2010</span>.</p>
<p>More announcements are coming soon. The 2011 festival lineup is growing daily, with many exciting additions, along with a brand new website to host all the information.
