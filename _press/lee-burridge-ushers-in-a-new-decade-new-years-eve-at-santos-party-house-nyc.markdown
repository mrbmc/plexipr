LEE BURRIDGE<br />
NEW YEAR'S EVE MASQUERADE<br />
@ Santos Party House</strong></p>
<p>The countdown has begun.  <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> invites you to say goodbye to a fantastic decade and hello to the new - with the king of eclectic techno and perennial New York favorite,<strong> Lee Burridge</strong> at <strong>Santos Party House</strong> this New Year’s Eve on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, December 31st, 2009</strong></span>.  The noughties were a dance music party that never ended and for this momentous masquerade,  Lee will soundtrack our collective farewell to the departing decade. Come in your finest masks or bearded disguises and get ready to ring in the new year with a special midnight toast in the city that never sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Burridge</strong> has a reputation synonymous with musical creativity and amazing parties.  With a career that spans two decades, his sound still cannot truly be defined.  Never the less, it is a sound that has been showcased in almost every major club and festival from Israel to America and Asia to South Africa.    His wonky, bouncy and sublime house and techno sets have provided NYC with some of its most exciting nights in recent memory.  Over the years a special bond has forged between Lee and the Big Apple, so it only seems appropriate that we usher in the New Year by allowing him to take control and mastermind the dancefloor of downtown boite Santos Party House as only he can.  If you witnessed his sets at the annual San Francisco<em> Love</em> parade, <em>Burning Man</em>, <em>Save the Cannibals</em> or his infamous WMC soiree’s <em>The Burridge Barrage</em>, you know to expect the unexpected when he digs through the crates.  But one thing is certain, his blend of funky house, tech house and pulsating techno never fails to move the body and stimulate the mind.  Once the don of the Hong Kong club scene and  <em>Tyrant</em> partner with Craig Richards, Burridge has undoubtedly etched his name amongst dance music’s most elite while maintaining a position as  a crowd favorite the world over.</p>
