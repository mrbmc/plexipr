<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Made Event</strong> presents UK electrohouse sensation <strong>D. RAMIREZ</strong> with Basic NYC’s <em>Sleepy &amp; Boo</em> at <strong>Cielo</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, February 1st, 2008</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Dean Marriott’s (aka <strong>D. Ramirez</strong>) first venture into production was in mid-90s with partner Neil Hinde, under the pseudonym Lisa Marie Experience. After a successful release of "Keep on Jumpin" (including a Top of the Pops appearance), Dean had a change of path and went from the commercial side of music down to the underground. Thus the D. Ramirez moniker was born. Since then labels such as Yoshitoshi, Choo Choo, Phonetic, Thrust, Junior, Whoop!, Lot 49, Four:Twenty and Toolroom have been clamoring for D.Ramirez material and producers such as Tom Stephan (Superchumbo), Deepgroove, Mark Knight, Max Linen and Meat Katie have all been lining up to work with him. His remix of Bodyrox “Yeah Yeah” was a bonafide breakout hit, reaching #2 in the UK national charts and #1 in Spain. In 2007, D. Ramirez was named DJ Mag's Best British Producer and Best British Remix 2006 (for “Yeah Yeah”). His debut mix CD for the Ministry of Sound Sessions was an electro-house monster with tracks from Stephan Bodzin, Claude von Stroke and Oliver Huntemann as well as a selection of Ramirez' own productions and remixes.</p>
<p>The new double <em>CD Rewind / Fast Forward</em> (Slave Recordings) mixed by D. Ramirez and his label prodigy Kristoph is stacked with D.Ramirez productions and remixes featuring exclusive, un-released &amp; re-edited tracks including remixes of Roger Sanchez, Plump DJs, Ferry Corsten and Peace Division. It’s a fantastic collection of music that underlines the importance of his productions over the last decade. With a new artist album on the horizon and talks of a live show for next year, things aren’t letting up anytime soon.</p>
