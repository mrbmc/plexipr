<p>A performance over a year in the making, the <strong>Electric Zoo Festival</strong> is proud to welcome <strong>Martin Solveig</strong> for his debut DJ set on <strong>Saturday, September 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Martin said “Hello” to the world in 2010 with the so-named blockbuster track that took the electronic music scene by storm. “Hello” went Platinum in the US, hit #1 in half a dozen countries, reached 100 million views on YouTube, and made the Frenchman a star. So much has happened since this initial success though, Solveig has continued and expanded his domination of the music world.</p>
<p>In April of 2012, Martin released his explosive The Night Out EP. In addition to the title track, it includes remixes from A-Trak, Madeon, The FatRat, and Maison &amp; Dragen. Also included is a previously unreleased version of “Can’t Stop,” featuring Solveig’s frequent collaborator<strong>Dragonette</strong>.</p>
<p>Solveig was also a primary producer on Madonna’s new album MDNA, which debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. Highlights include “Beautiful Killer” (inspired by Solveig and Madonna’s mutual passion for Jean-Pierre Melville’s classic crime thriller, Le Samouraï) and the hit single, “Give Me All Your Luvin” featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., which has proven an international sensation, topping airplay charts around the globe. Martin <a href="http://t.ymlp263.net/ubbyhaiamyeqazaeuealaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">recently told MTV News</a>, <em>"We were working with no limits. I think the only thing that she said when we started was 'I just want people to be able to dance to my music and connect easily with my music,' and also probably to take some risks at some point… Other than this, it was open to any kind of experimentation."</em></p>
<p>Another example of his creative abilities, Martin’s SMASH webseries is a breath of fresh air in a world full of YouTube videos. Each installment is not only a showcase for his music, but chock full of comedic flair, scenic irony, sarcasm, and semi-serious commentary on the electronic music scene. <a href="http://t.ymlp263.net/ubbywalamyeqataeueanaqmse/click.php" target="_blank">Episode #4</a> was released in April.</p>

<p><strong>About Martin Solveig</strong><br />
Like so many, Martin’s love affair with music began at an early age, influenced by luminaries such as Prince, Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Wonder and Serge Gainsbourg. But it was just one record that catapulted Martin from a well-respected DJ to one of the most formidable producers and performers in the world. “Hello” has now sold over 2 million copies and earned a global recognition, achieving platinum status in America, Italy, Germany and Austria, as well as going twice platinum in Canada and in Australia. His recent The Night Out EP and primary producer work on Madonna’s new album MDNA have solidified his position at the top. His eccentric taste and non-conformist attitude have been the backbone of what he is today – a multi faceted artist. He sings, he produces, he DJs, he acts, occasionally dances, and sometimes plays a spot of tennis.</p>
