SANDER VAN DOORN<br />
JOHN DAHLBÄCK<br />
<em>@ Pacha NYC</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Made Event</em> </strong>presents Dutch DJ sensation <strong>Sander Van Doorn</strong> and Sweden’s rising star <strong>John Dahlbäck</strong> at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, September 18, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>From the start <strong>Sander Van Doorn</strong> (and his alter egos; Sam Sharp, Purple Haze, Filterfunk &amp; Sandler) has produced a variety of sounds at a level that only most producers can dream of, combining elements of trance, electro, techno and house constantly blowing away his fans and comrades, while keeping us guessing about what’s will be next. His debut artist album Supernaturalistic was released in 2008 to rave reviews and launched a global album tour. He followed this by winning the coveted prize of ‘Best Breakthrough Artist’ at WMC’s IDMA, where he also received a nomination for ‘Best Underground Track’ with ‘Riff’.  He is one of the most in-demand genre crossing producers of his generation, regularly picking up support from DJ’s like Pete Tong, Judge Jules, Tiesto and Carl Cox .  Not content with taking the world by storm with his productions, Sander’s DJ skills are a force to be reckoned with. Every year sees Sander playing to over one million clubbers. He consistently headlines huge events from Sensation to Global Gathering, from Trance Energy and Mysteryland through to his high profile summer residency at Cream in Ibiza. With his accomplishments at such an early stage for, it’s easy to see where this man’s career is heading – No.1.</p>
<p>Swedish electro chief <strong>John Dahlbäck</strong> is still in his early twenties, but he’s had more releases than girlfriends with a singles discography edging ever closer to the hundred mark by the week. Even from an early age, John was learning the basics on his dad’s Atari computer and he soon established his own style, which blossomed into becoming one of the best young producers to date. Not soon after his initial success, he knew it was time to take the next step. Together with his cousin Jesper Dahlbäck, they produced under the moniker Hugg &amp; Pepp to huge acclaim and launched their own Pickadoll imprint, boasting top releases from Özgur Can, Sebastien Leger, Dada Life, Zoo Brazil, Robbie Rivera, Laidback Luke and Style of Eye.</p>
