<p>\Award winning clubs Cielo in association with<em><strong> Pacha NYC</strong></em> present <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong>, <strong>Willie Graff,</strong> <strong>Ted Patterson</strong>, <strong>Danny Krivit</strong> and <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> at <strong>Water Taxi Beach</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Monday, May 25, 2009</strong></span>,  for a special Memorial day soiree to kick-off the summer season. Dance in the soft white sand, enjoy amazing views of the Manhattan skyline and sip a tropical drink, ice cold beer or frozen lemonade at Water Taxi Beach. This is the perfect place for New Yorkers to celebrate summer  without leaving the city. This 44,000 square foot beach just a 4-minute Water Taxi ride from midtown Manhattan boasts brilliant sunshine during the day, beach &amp; cocktail menu, a volleyball net, tents for shade from the sun, all included with the perfect house music soundtrack.</p>
<p>Cielo resident DJs <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> and <strong>Willie Graff </strong>will certainly be showcasing tunes from their latest club series installment <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cielo: Playtime</strong></span> out on  June 9th, 2009 on <em>Tommy Boy</em>. Nicolas Matar’s diverse musical style encompasses everything from Deep House, Soulful House, Nu-Jazz, Techno, to Disco Classics. While, Willie Graff is known for spinning an array of house music genres while incorporating a deep, moody and minimal style.</p>
<p><strong>Tedd Patterson</strong>’s maniacal, hypnotic, deep, and percussive <em>Vibal</em> house sounds will take you back to that ever nostalgic underground vibe that everyone is trying to re-catch these days.  His Vibal parties, at New York's Cielo, is a capacity crowd of multi-ethnic and poly-amorous fashionistas, pretty boys, old school house heads, legendary children, and curious party crashers. Surely he will take us all in a journey past, present and future.</p>
<p>Legendary dj/producer/remixer <strong>Danny Krivit</strong> will be taking his Body &amp; Soul fresh, deep cut, hypnotic tunes to the beach this Memorial Day. With over 35+ years of experience and a slew of residencies, Danny Krivit has left his mark in clubs throughout New York City.  Danny is still on top with his current residency with <em>718 Sessions</em>.</p>
<p><em>West End Records</em> very own <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> aka <strong>Blaze </strong>is all too familiar with being across rivers. Growing up in Newark, NJ, he always dreamed of making it across the river in Manhattan. This legendary dj/producer with such immense releases like De’Lacy Hideaway sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. Co-founder and part owner of Club Shelter which hosted legends like Timmy Regisford and Freddy Sanon, Kevin Hedge is a legend of his own right in dance music history.</p>
<p>This Memorial Day our very own NYC DJ legends will perform their legendary sounds to all. Summertime sunshine, hot dogs, hamburgers and children doing hula hops on the dancefloor. This will be a packed house with a sound system that clearly fits the setting by Gary Stewart. A summer kick off not to be missed where all four legendary DJs will be shinning as brightly as the summer sun at Water Taxi Beach.</p>
