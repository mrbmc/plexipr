<strong>Made Event presents<br />
ABOVE &amp; BEYOND<br />
Anjunadeep 01: World Album Tour 2009<br />
With Jaytech</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong> on their world tour for <em><strong>Anjunadeep 01</strong></em> mix CD at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, February 20th , 2009</strong></span>. On this special evening, Above &amp; Beyond will showcase the Anjunadeep sound in the early part of their sets and through supporting DJ <strong>Jaytech</strong>, before progressing to the quality melodic trance sound for which they are best known.</p>
<p>In a short period of time, <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong>’s Anjunadeep imprint has grown from being a promising sibling to the Anjunabeats label, to a dynamic and influential imprint in its own right, pioneering a sound somewhere between house and trance.  About the label’s sound, Above &amp; Beyond’s Tony McGuinness said: <em>"The road between house and trance used to be a dusty, barren path, visited by only the truly brave. But in the last few years it has become an exciting, bustling place with constant traffic going both ways. Anjunadeep is that lovely, shiny building on the left with all the people looking in the window."</em> Winning fans such as James Zabiela, Desyn Masiello, Eric Prydz and Laurent Garnier along the way, Anjunadeep recently received a nomination for "Best Record Label" at DJ Magazine’s Best of British Awards 2008.</p>
<p>The label's debut compilation, <em><strong>Anjunadeep:01</strong></em> features Anjunadeep stalwarts Jaytech, Michael Cassette (aka Komytea), Interplay, Joonas Hahmo and recent high profile addition 16 Bit Lolitas.  They are joined by newer faces like Colombia's Liluca, Russia's Proff and Canadian Paul Keeley, as Above &amp; Beyond conjure up two CDs of spirited melodic house music. A special treat comes in the form of Above &amp; Beyond’s own remix of Radiohead's "Reckoner”, officially licensed via XL Recordings for the physical format only.</p>
