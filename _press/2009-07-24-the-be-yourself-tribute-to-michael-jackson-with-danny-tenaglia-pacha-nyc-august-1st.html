<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents a very special <em>Be Yourself</em> tribute to <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> featuring music by <strong>Danny Tenaglia </strong>on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, August 1, 2009</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As a child star, he was immensely talented he seemed lit from within. In a decade, he became the world's most popular entertainer thanks to a series of hit records; “Beat It", Billie Jean”, “Thriller” and dazzling music videos.  Perhaps the best dancer of his generation, he created his own iconography: the single shiny glove, the Moonwalk, the signature red jacket and the Neverland Ranch but Michael Jackson was that and more...he had grace, passion, fire, soul and most importantly he had love.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson was an inspiration to many including Danny Tenaglia. Danny goes on to share, “<em>MJ was more a part of my life than most might ever imagine! The loss of MJ has shattered ‘Another Part of Me’ and I just feel like I want everyone to know exactly how I feel.</em>”  On this special tribute night, keep an ear out for the never-before released massive Danny Tenaglia edit of Jackson’s “Thriller” mash-up with “Be Yourself” entitled “Thrill Yourself”.</p>
