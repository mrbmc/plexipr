One of 2008's biggest success stories in dance music, <strong>Mark Knight</strong> leads the way this February with the launch of an exciting new <strong><em>Toolroom Knights</em></strong> residency at <strong>Pacha New York</strong> on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, February 27th, 2009</span></strong>.</p>
<p>On his pending invasion of New York, the Toolroom Knights head honcho explained, “<em>I made my mind up that 2009 would be the year to bring the sound of Toolroom Knights to the states, and Pacha seemed the perfect place to start building</em>.” On his decision to choose Pacha, he says, “<em>having played at Pacha in 2008 I fell in love with the place - the sound system, the vibe, the people. I felt totally at home.”</em> He continues on regarding the New York residency, “<em>I’ve always been fascinated by the legacy of New York clubbing, the way it was structured around one DJ and one journey all night long. From way back at studio 54 with Larry Levan to Tenaglia and Vasquez, and the legendary Sound Factory to Sasha &amp; Digweed, but there seemed to be a hole in this legacy, so I thought it was time someone new stepped in and kept things moving. Whilst playing at Space in Ibiza with Sasha we spoke about the concept and he said go for it! So, the next day I spoke with Pacha’s Rob Fernandez [Director of Promotions] and we made it happen. I want to make my Toolroom Knights NYC residency an authentic New York clubbing experience.</em>”</p>
<p>After delivering one of last year's most favored dance floor destroyers, the remake of the classic “Man With The Red Face”, Toolroom's music making machine Mark Knight now brings the underground sound of his label to NYC for an exciting bi-monthly residency, and promises to reignite the passion of New York clubbing with a 7 hour audio assault -  Toolroom style! Plus, an extended late-night afterhours session in Pachita.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2006, Toolroom Knights have successfully conquered dance floors the world over, hosting show stopping parties from Ministry of Sound London to Amnesia Ibiza, and every where in between.</p>
