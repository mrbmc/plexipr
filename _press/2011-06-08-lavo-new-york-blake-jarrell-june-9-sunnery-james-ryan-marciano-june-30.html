<p><strong>Thursday, June 9 – Blake Jarrell</strong><br />
Blake Jarrell is one of the fastest rising stars in the dance music industry today. Besides traveling all over the world, both solo and under the wing of DJ Mag’s #1 DJ, Armin van Buuren, he’s also continuously putting out new original music and remix work. With a mix compilation for Armada Dancefloor Sessions series out, his hit “Punta del Este” was featured on Armin’s acclaimed ‘A State of Trance 2008’ compilation and his remix of Moussa Clark’s “She Wants Him” stayed in the #1 position on Beatport’s trance charts for several weeks. Blake’s monthly radio show, ‘Concentrate,’ features signature mix sets and special international guests. Jarrell’s  unique approach to creating new music takes his listeners on a journey, as he selects track names that are inspired by his surroundings, like the upcoming “Maldives (Original Mix)” out July 11th.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, June 30 – Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano</strong><br />
Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano are an energetic Dutch duo who match soulful vocals with deep and funky house. When not performing all over the globe, they can be found in their Amsterdam studio coming up with one dancefloor destroyer after another. Their 2008 debut tracks include “Pina” and “Lift U Up feat. Reese &amp; Chappell,” after which Steve Angello scooped up “Traffic” and “Snitch” for release on his Size Records label. The duo has also made several remixes for the likes of Sander Kleinenberg (“This Is Our Night”), Kaskade (“Dynasty”) and Diplo ft. Busta Rhymes (“C’mon”). Last year, Sunnery &amp; Ryan debuted at the prestigious Sensation event and played at Pacha Ibiza alongside Swedish House Mafia. This month, they debut a fresh and happy progressive-meets-tech house track called “We Are” on Mixmash records, out June 16th.</p>
