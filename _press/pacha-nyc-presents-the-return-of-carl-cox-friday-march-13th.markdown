Pacha NYC presents<br />
CARL COX<br />
<em>24/7 Back In The USA The Tour<br />
The King of Clubs Returns To Pacha NYC </em></strong></p>
<p>The three deck wizard and King of Clubs, <strong>Carl Cox</strong> returns to <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, March 13th</strong></span> to play host to club kids and dance floor veterans alike. Cox may have sold over a quarter million mix CD’s, been the host of some of the biggest nights in dance music history, but he still knows how to keep it simple behind the decks: one, two, or three of them. On this pending tour, Cox says, “<em>I just wanted to go back to basics. Carl Cox and Friends is all about the ‘show’ but this tour’s going to be about the music and me as an individual DJ. I still have that pioneering spirit and I want to celebrate the scene with the US’s amazing crowds.</em>” With Pacha NYCs award winning all Dynacord sound system, it will be very easy to showcase the best tunes this mega-DJ has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Cox Global</strong>, the King’s radio show, recently celebrated 6 years on air and the 300th broadcast milstone. “<em>I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished – 6 years of airtime at this level is phenomenal and the 300th show will be spectacular</em>,” says Carl. The 300th show is just another huge achievement after an astonishing year. This past summer, Carl returned to Space for the seventh year in a row, with a host of iconic mates including Francois K, Laurent Garnier &amp; Fatboy Slim taking to the decks. He toured the USA, storming the Burning Man Festival in Nevada and bringing his Carl Cox &amp; Friends Arena to the Winter Music Conference for a 4th year running. He also dropped massive shows across South America, Europe, the Far East and Australia, played exclusive F1 parties across the world, and still had energy left to claim the SW4 crown once more at Clapham Common.</p>
