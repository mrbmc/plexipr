<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents globe-trotting DJ<strong> Markus Schulz</strong>, playing an extended set at <strong>Pacha </strong>with AlterImage on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, May 23rd</span>.</strong></p>
<p>2008 kicks off with the release of <strong>Markus Schulz</strong>’s fourth compilation ‘Amsterdam 08’ for Armada Music This album follows in the footsteps of Miami 05 and Ibiza 06, and Markus Schulz couldn’t be happier about its origins – Amsterdam is his spiritual home thanks to the overwhelming passion of the people resident there. “I always choose cities that are dear to me for my annual mix compilation” says Markus. “I just love Amsterdam, I feel a real connection there – my friends there are like my family. The people of Holland were one of the first to embrace and accept me and my sound, so it was the natural choice to do the 08 mix there.”</p>
<p>Markus’ brand of dark, melodic trance is in demand the world over; his weekly Global DJ Broadcast radio show is now syndicated to over 30 stations worldwide, his shows have taken in everywhere from Australia to Russia, China to Trinidad, and many other destinations along the way, and 2008 is set to bring more dates in Australia, as well as Asia and South America. Amsterdam 08 is a must-have album for dance fans everywhere, and comprises Markus’ top tracks from 2007 and hot tips for 2008.</p>
<p>Next up, Markus Schulz is firing on all cylinders at the moment with four massive new remixes of his 2007 smash track, “Daydream”. The remixes come from some of the hottest producers on the scene right now. Einar K and Lemon storm in with two takes on the original, the Progressive Remix and the stunning Uplifting Remix, which is guaranteed to give you goose-bumps with its soaring euphoric melodies and driving basslines. Progressive-trance master Benya turns in his hand, providing a beautifully dubby, dreamy track perfect for those sun-soaked terrace mornings. Finally German sensation Ronski Speed lets loose a thundering new mix with bass-heavy rhythms wrapped around the original tune and vocals.</p>
<p>His second artist album, Progression, released in 2007, offers listeners a slice of his trademark dark, melodic trance, alongside chilled tracks, guitars, and sublime vocals. Says Markus, “Progression was conceived in the summer, whereas the debut album was done and released in winter, so Progression is less dark, and more influenced by sunny days in Miami. ‘Trinidad to Miami’ was actually written while I was flying over the ocean with the sun shining on the water, and encapsulates that feeling of optimism and happiness.”</p>
<p>Markus, who also runs his own Coldharbour label, has over the past three years crossed the globe on an almost constant basis; from Australia to Russia, and as far away as China and Trinidad. Along with playing his hometown of Miami, Markus was also found in Ibiza at his summer residency at Amnesia; The Two Tribes Tour in Australia and New Zealand; Tomorrowland in Belgium; Mysterland and Trance Energy in The Netherlands; Nature One in Germany; Distant Heat in Jordan, and clubs in Kuala Lumpur, Romania, Czech Republic, Mexico, Sweden, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, UK, Boston, Los Angeles, and New York, as the list goes on. With Markus showing no sign of slowing down in 2008, he is a man on a mission to meet the world.</p>
