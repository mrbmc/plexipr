NEW ISLAND FESTIVAL presents</em><br />
ARMIN VAN BUUREN</strong></p>
<p>As part of the <strong>New Island Festival</strong>’s celebration of provocative theatre, stunning site specific performances and dazzling visual arts, world famous Dutch DJ <strong>Armin van Buuren </strong>will be bringing the dance floor to <strong>Governors Island’s Water Taxi Beach</strong> for a FREE dance party on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, September 12th</strong></span>, 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>As a producer, DJ, and electronic music pioneer, <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong> has secured his place as one of the most influential musicians around. Known as an innovator of trance, Van Buuren is largely considered the #1 DJ in the world, playing to enormous sold out crowds, and broadcasting his weekly radio show “A State of Trance” to over 30 million people in 40 countries, making it the largest radio audience on the planet!</p>
<p>Direct from Holland, the <em><strong>New Island Festival</strong></em> will set up stakes on New York City's Governors Island from September 10–13 and again from September 17–20. The festival will kick off the fall with provocative theatre, stunning site-specific performance, dazzling visual arts and exhilarating DJ sets, performed by world-class Dutch performers. More than 150 artists will perform during the festival to celebrate the universal character of art and culture, and the special bond between Holland and New York City.</p>
<p>Before his set, Armin van Buuren will be officially announced by the Dutch royal family’s Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Máxima of The Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>GETTING THERE…</strong> A Water Taxi departing from Pier 11 at the base of Wall St. (just a few blocks south of the South Street Seaport) will bring you to the Water Taxi Beach. Entry is FREE but you must purchase a $10 round trip Water Taxi ticket to get to the island. <em>*Admission to the event requires the purchase of this ticket on the Water Taxi and travel to Governors Island on these reserved boats.</em> Water Taxis will be leaving from Pier 11 in Manhattan every 15 minutes starting at 11am.  <a href="http://www.newislandfestival.com/">GET YOUR TICKETS HERE!</a></p>
<p>After the show, stay and enjoy all the other events happening at the New Island Festival, including the Silent Disco (a "quiet" dance party where all the participants wear headphones) and all of the incredible free shows on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams at the center of the festival. Governors Island will be open until 12 midnight!</p>
<p>The <strong>New Island Festival</strong> is part of<strong> NY400</strong>, which celebrates the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's voyage from Amsterdam to New York Harbor, and commemorates 400 years of enduring friendship between the Netherlands and the United States.</p>
