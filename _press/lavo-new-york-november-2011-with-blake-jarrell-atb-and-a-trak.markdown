<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday, November 3<sup>rd</sup> – Blake Jarrell</strong><br />
Rising superstar and New Orleans native Blake Jarrell began his introduction into house music at the young age of 15. After receiving a full scholarship to Loyola University New Orleans' College of Music Business he moved to Chicago to further immerse himself in his passion. Blake's chance encounter with perennial top DJ, and mentor, Armin van Buuren offered him an opportunity to join Armada's respected roster. He has since traveled to over 50 countries and 100 cities and his music has received support from such acts as Markus Schulz, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, Paul van Dyk, Pete Tong, Gareth Emery, John Digweed, Paul Oakenfold and, of course, Armin van Buuren. His residencies at Amnesia and Space in Ibiza soon grew to include residencies at Marquee in Las Vegas and Circus in Montreal. His hard work, dedication, and respect for the art are clearly shown in his mastered productions and live sets. Be sure to tune into Blake Jarrell's monthly podcast "Concentrate.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thursday November 10<sup>th</sup> - ATB</strong><br />
ATB, born Andre Tanneberger, is one of Germany's crowning gifts to the electronic dance music world. Now on the heels of his eighth artist album 'Distant Earth', ATB lands in NYC for his debut performance at intimate dance music boite LAVO, a very rare occasion to see a superstar trance giant. On 'Distant Earth', ATB once again delivers an array of fantastic new songs, which transcend the genres of dance, trance and pop with collaborations with renowned artists - the pioneering figures of Armin van Buuren and Dash Berlin to a remarkable team-up with Rea Garvey, who came to fame as lead singer of the international star act Reamonn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His seminal trance anthem “9pm (Till I Come)” is widely regarded as the first trance song to ever reach the #1 spot on the charts. Thirteen years and 8 studio albums later, ATB is still moving strong and was recently voted as The DJ List's #1 DJ in the world. His masterful productions have progressed to include live instruments and lofty female vocalists. ATB's signature pitched guitar sound, universally recognized harmonies, and emotion-laden melodies seem to effortlessly transcend musical barriers. It's no wonder why his loyal fans and music addicts continuously tout him as one of the finest electronic music acts today. ATB is currently in the middle of his U.S. tour, showcasing his music in major cities like Las Vegas, Miami, and New York.</p>

A Montreal native who now calls Brooklyn home, A-Trak effortlessly blends an eclectic mix of genres into highly addictive dance music. He has support from acts like MSTRKRFT, Laidback Luke, Simian Mobile Disco, Boys Noize, Diplo and countless others.
