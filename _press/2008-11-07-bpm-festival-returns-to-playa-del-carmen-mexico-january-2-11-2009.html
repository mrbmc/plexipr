<p>The festival’s second installment will commence January 2nd 2009 and run through January 11th 2009. Initially conceived as an exclusive networking event for nightlife professionals from around the world, the festival is now a clubber’s xanadu in the number one destination for beach and eco tourism in the heart of the Mexican Caribbean.</p>
<p>BPM Festival Co-producer and Circa Director Craig Pettigrew says, “We’re excited to return to Playa del Carmen for the 2nd year with our team of nightlife professionals. The festival provides the perfect escape after the clubbing industry’s busiest season and a welcome respite from the cold. With its numerous nightclubs and beautiful pristine beaches, Playa del Carmen is the newest ‘IT’ destination for global clubbing.”</p>
<p>With the extended dates, the BPM Festival 2009 will feature even more top-flight international artists than last year. The daytime beach party sessions will kick off each day with a world-class line-up. At night, the stunning lineup of  Artists confirmed so far include; Get Physical’s two-headed beast <strong>M.A.N.D.Y.</strong>, flying Dutchman <strong>SANDER KLEINENBERG</strong>, the “King of Space” <strong>STEVE LAWLER</strong>, getting weirder by the minute <strong>LEE BURRIDGE</strong>, Crosstown Rebels head honcho <strong>DAMIAN LAZARUS</strong>, Spanish house heartthrob <strong>PABLO CEBALLOS</strong> [of Chus &amp; Ceballos] and Toronto’s rising star <strong>SEAN MILLER</strong>, alongside an ever-expanding line up to be announced over the coming months. Also, Circa residents <strong>DOMAN+PETTIGREW</strong> will be performing at an exotic underground cave party for a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience!</p>
<p>Playa del Carmen is a stunningly beautiful, vibrant part of the Mayan Riviera, located on the pristine Caribbean coast of Mexico. Blessed with miles of unspoiled white sand beaches and crystal-clear Caribbean waters, Playa del Carmen offers an unforgettable time and endless adventures. Filled with a variety of beautiful and affordable boutique hotels and nightclubs, an endless number of places for dining, dancing, beach parties, and clubbing; without a doubt Playa del Carmen has the best ambiance throughout all the Caribbean.</p>
