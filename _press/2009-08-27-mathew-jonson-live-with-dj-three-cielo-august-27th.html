<strong>MATHEW JONSON</strong> (live)<br />
(Wagon Repair / CA)<br />
<strong>with THREE</strong><br />
(HallucinationLimited.com / NYC)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday, August 27, 2009</strong></span>, <strong>Mathew Jonson</strong> will be bringing his unique solo LIVE performance to New York City at <strong>Cielo</strong> along with DJ stalwart <strong>Three</strong>.</p>
<p>Canada’s <strong>Mathew Jonson</strong> has become one of the preeminent producers and DJ’s in electronic music today. Recording on internationally renowned labels such as <em>Sub Static</em>, <em>Minus</em>, <em>Perlon</em>, <em>Kompakt</em>, <em>Itiswhatitis</em>, <em>Arbutus</em>, and his own label <em>Wagon Repair</em>, Jonson has created some of the most influential tracks of the past few years. He forges influences from techno, jazz, house, drum ‘n’ bass and fusion to create flowing bass lines and synth melodies which produce his trademark tech-fusion sound. Mathew is also unique in his ability to improvise and perform with other players in a live group setting. This has resulted in musical formations such as the <strong>Modern Deep Left Quartet</strong> and <strong>Cobblestone Jazz</strong>, who have developed an international reputation for their intensely soulful and masterful composition that translates both in recording sessions and in live performance. Joining Jonson on this special night is <strong>Three</strong>. Aside from his natural ability on the decks, Three sets himself apart from the rest of the pack by presenting eclectic sounds with an open-minded attitude towards everything he does. From DJ sets to musical output, Three is a "DJ's DJ" who has always leaned toward the cutting edge without losing touch with the roots of house and techno.</p>
