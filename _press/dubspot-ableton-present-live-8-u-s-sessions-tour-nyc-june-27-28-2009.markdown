<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DubSpot’s Live 8 US Sessions</strong> tour is coming home to NYC! After a successful maiden voyage to San Francisco (<a href="http://dubspot.squarespace.com/blog/2009/5/19/live-8-us-sessions-tour-san-fran-recap-video.html">video&gt;&gt;</a>) last month, we are preparing our home-field advantage stop for the weekend of June 27th &amp; 28th. Join us for a unique series of interactive workshops, Q&amp;As and live performances from a diverse pool of talented artists, instructors and established musicians. Experience five ‘sessions’ daily, each specially designed to developed and enhance a diverse range of your production and performance abilities. Our tour will showcase just how far-reaching the capabilities of Live 8 are, and why it is the most advanced piece of music software on the planet.  Come learn from Ableton Live experts &amp; veteran producers and who will be coming together to help take your skills to the next level!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday 6.27</strong></span><br />
<strong>Live 8 in the Studio: 'The Production Process &amp; Beyond'</strong><br />
We understand that mastering work-flow methods and moving projects through the entire production process can be quite a challenge, for both aspiring and experienced producers alike. To address this, carefully selected artists/instructors will complete an original track and guide participants through the creative process of music making - start to finish...live! To begin, <em><strong>KJ Sawka </strong></em>(a master drummer and producer) will demonstrate and create customized drum and instrument rack set-ups from his own live recordings. Next, <em><strong>DJ Kiva</strong></em> will begin to construct a song by introducing bass, synth lines, and vocals to KJ's drums. After moving the track from session view to arrange view, <em><strong>Jon Margulies</strong></em> will take over and detail creative and efficient methods for finishing your mixes. Then, <em><strong>Daniel Wyatt</strong></em>, a talented veteran engineer, will discuss mastering techniques for creating professional, finalized products. The final session of the day will see techno legend <em><strong>Richie Hawtin</strong></em> and his label-mate <em><strong>Ambivalent</strong></em> giving their own take on the process as a whole, covering unique tricks and strategies that help them forge the sounds of the Minus imprint.<br />

<strong>Performing with Live: 'Taking Ableton on Stage'</strong><br />
Learning how to fully exploit and utilize the program’s capabilities in a live setting is the focus of today’s sessions. The day will begin with Jon Margulies providing programming strategies for creating an effective Live set, while controlling with the Akai APC40, which has sent shock-waves through the controller industry. Following Jon, DJ Rupture will incorporate a variety of outside instruments, such as vocals, guitar, violin, and a variety of acoustic instruments.
