<p>August heralds another month of genre-defining, award-winning, dancefloor-filling DJs to grace the Cielo’s decks and educate, enthrall and stimulate the senses. International clubbing bible ResidentAdvisor.net recently designated Cielo the #12 club in the world and the highest ranking North American club in its top 100 roundup. This month Roger Sanchez, Gilles Peterson, King Britt, Martijn Ten Velden, and Steve Lawler are just a handful of our guests covering every angle of the dance music spectrum in what promises to be an aurally edifying August!</p>
<p><strong>Marques Wyatt</strong>, Cielo’s summer resident, kicks things off in fine style on Friday the 1st with his Deep night. Expect a self-assured set of deep soulful grooves with a spiritual message to match Marques’ cool and silky smooth persona. While many say Californian-resident was responsible for the birth of West Coast house scene by bringing the fresh sounds of New York to Los Angeles in the mid-80s. The night runs 11pm-4am, with advance tickets $10 or $20 on the door.</p>
<p><strong>Gilles Peterson</strong> is widely acclaimed as a true musical tastemaker, educating and influencing dancefloors and global listeners through his worldwide radio show on BBC Radio 1 for more years then he’d care to mention. August 7th is the date for your diary as Giant Step presents one of the most innovative, eclectic, and err, genuinely nice DJs the UK dance scene has ever produced. With a resume that includes launching the groundbreaking Acid Jazz and Talkin’ Loud labels, through to exposing jazz, Latin dance and bossa nova funk, and its many sub-genres, to new generations via his award winning radio show, Gilles has done it all. Arrive early (doors open at 10pm) or better still get advance $15 tickets from Giantstep.net</p>
<p>Having made his name via residences at Space, Cream, and Twilo, <strong>Steve Lawler</strong> is used to the big stage. The globetrotter was also one of the key players in British house music movement that circumnavigated the world in the ‘90s and made him one of the most talked about DJs and producers of the era, regularly mentioned in dispatches alongside Sasha &amp; Digweed; he also released numerous singles through the latter’s Bedrock label. August 8th promises to be a BIG Friday night and sell out event, so to avoid disappointment $15 advance tickets are available from Ticketweb.com</p>
<p><strong>Victor Calderone</strong>, the man who gave Madonna a progressive edge all those years ago, is the headline guest for Dance.Here.Now on the 14th.  For over a decade the New Yorker has been behind some of the most musical, melodic and enveloping twisted tribal house and dark funky beats this city has produced. His sets have been described as “deep driving grooves, brisk tribal percussion, sexually charged basslines and provocative vocals.” In other words it’s a tribal house fan’s dream: hot, steamy, sexy and created with the sole purpose of making you dance. ($20 advance tickets from Danceherenownyc.com)</p>
<p>The UK invasion continues on Friday 15th, with the headline of another disciple of tech-house, <strong>Craig Richards</strong>. Last month we welcomed Lee Burridge, Craig’s partner in the groundbreaking Tyrant night at Fabric in London, now Cielo &amp; Blk|Market present the other half of the acclaimed duo for a night of hot sweaty techno-laced house blended with a variety of styles. With Craig you never know quite what you’re gonna get except a damn good time! (The night runs 11pm-4am, with advance tickets $15 from Ticketweb.com or $25 on the door.)</p>
<p><strong>King Britt</strong> has always strived to push the envelope further than most dance producers, and in so doing he’s rightfully earned the recognition as an architect of the cool, stylish and deep. Britt is still the master of timeless sounding releases and remixes that perfectly blend the best of yesteryear with the contemporary awareness for the present forged on a mixture of genres that show the eclectic and open-minded DJ to the full. Hear for yourself a celebration of the soul, funk and jazz that inspires the innovative producer from the City of Brotherly Love at Deep Space on Monday 18th; doors open at 9:30 with a $12 cover.</p>
<p>A few years ago it seemed like nearly every quality dance release was emblazoned with <strong>Martijn Ten Velden</strong> name; winning the praise of the likes of Roger Sanchez, Deep Dish, Pete Tong and Steve Lawler in the process. While last year talented Dutchman was nominated for Best Artist and Outstanding Remix at the House Music Awards. Dance.Here.Now presents his unique style of undeniably funky house infused with tribal and electro overtones on August 21st. (Advance tickets are available from Danceherenownyc.com)</p>
<p>Playtime on the 22nd hosts a night with one of Baltimore’s finest house producers and DJs, <strong>Karizma</strong>. Along with DJ Spen in the ‘90s, the two releases a slew of acclaimed singles, and remixed the likes of Everything But The Girl, Lenny Kravitz, Roy Ayers and Jocelyn Brown. It was also in these remixes Karizma developed the “Deepah Dubs” and “Deepah Ones” moniker that he still uses today aptly highlighting some of the most inspirational soulful-gospel-house-messages of our generation. (11pm-4am, $20 cover charge, $10 before 1am)</p>
<p><strong>Roger Sanchez</strong> is as busy clocking up the international DJ air miles as he’s ever been. Any given weekday you’ll find him spinning in Tokyo, Ibiza, Sydney, London, or on Thursday, August 28th, New York. Having started out in the late-‘80s on the streets of Queens breakdancing and making mix tapes, he now spreads his time running Stealth Records, releasing material as a chart-topping artist, and wowing dancefloors the world over. The latter takes pride of place as Secret Soul Sessions present the Grammy Award winning S-Man at Cielo. It’s another must-attend event, so make sure you come early to avoid the rush, or better still book in advance to take advantage of the $20 ticket price; it’s $30 on the night.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the successful production partner of Gabriel &amp; Dresden was dissolved as the two equally talented hit men went their separate ways. Six months on and San Francisco’s <strong>Dave Dresden</strong> is building the next chapter of his career both in the studio and behind the decks. The electronic dance pioneer is special guest of the Made Event on the 29th. As you’d expect from the well-traveled maestro of prog-house, it’s bound to be an hallucinogenic journey through anthemic vocal numbers, ethereal moods and, of course, the best in progressiveness. (10pm-4am, $15 advance tickets at Ticketweb.com)</p>
