<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.cieloclub.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-1748 aligncenter" title="Cielo" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Cielo.jpg" alt="Cielo" width="221" height="74" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cielo Funktion One Sound System Upgrade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cielo</strong>’s state-of-the-art space in the ultra chic Meat Packing District is known for being one of New York City’s true destinations for dance-music aficionados, as it sets a higher standard in the ultimate nightlife experience by combining an unparalleled roster of world-class DJs with superior sound and ambience in an intimate setting. Cielo has won countless awards for its musical programming and atmosphere, but it’s the sound that has made it the nerve center for electronic dance music in North America.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Cielo was the first venue in all of North America to install a <em><strong>Funktion One</strong></em> sound system, and has since then served as the company’s main showcase venue. Daniel Agne of <em>Sound Investment AV</em> performed the original installation when the club opened and he has exclusively tuned and maintained the system over the years.</p>
<p><em>Funktion One</em> are continually advancing audio quality and wherever possible provide an upgrade path for existing products in the field ensuring that clients maintain state of the art. Cielo is the first of the <em>Funktion One</em> clubs worldwide to benefit from the recent upgrades to the technology, completed early in October by Tony Andrews of <em>Funktion One</em>. With this recent upgrade at Cielo, the Infrabass 218s were fitted with improved dampening material giving a smoother, fatter bass.  The AX88s and Resolution 2 monitors were fitted with a more advanced Funktion One designed 8" loudspeaker resulting in faster, crisper mid range and refining the blend between the 8" and the high frequency units. Overall, the transient ability of the system has been raised to a new level, further raising the bar for a quality clubbing experience.</p>
