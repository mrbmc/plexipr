<p><strong> </strong>San Francisco’s <em><strong>Dave Dresden</strong></em> is fast making <strong>Cielo NYC</strong> his second home, and he returns to close out the summer on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, September 25th</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years he’s committed himself to music with a career spanning every aspect of the industry, working as a DJ, journalist, A&amp;R, radio music director, and remixer. A master at weaving prog-house grooves that are cool enough for the serious heads, yet muscular enough to generate some much-needed street appeal, Dresden’s sets similarly mix ‘n’ match the new with the old, and the underground with the crossover.</p>
<p>Dave has kept a frantic pace in the studio since his last performance at Cielo. He and his production co-hort Mikael Johnston have been hard at work on numerous original songs. Two massive vocal tracks are the big story from their summer in the studio including "Keep Faith" which features the voice of newcomer Mezo Riccio and "That Day" which is a duet between Nadia Ali and Johnston. The future sees Dresden &amp; Johnston putting all these pieces together and more for their debut album which they would like to have completed by WMC 2010. Be ready to hear a lot of new sounds and fan favorites to round out Dave Dresden’s 2009 Cielo NYC residency.</p>
