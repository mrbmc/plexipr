<p><b>Made Event</b> presents <b>Adam Freeland</b> as he emerges on <b>Global Underground for a special GU : 32 Mexico City</b> album release party at award winning nightclub <b>Cielo on Friday, June 29th</b> with special guests Tim Sweeney and fellow Marine Parade cohort K-Swing.</p>
<p><b>Adam Freeland</b> may be best known for his prolific breakbeats, Marine Parade label and forward-thinking live band Freeland, but he now stands at the forefront of a new sound, blending tripped out rock music with a dancefloor attitude. His first foray onto the acclaimed Global Underground series features this newfound sound with sounds percolating from nouveau French house, to experimental techno, and electro. He injects his own signature stamp into the mix with his infamous re-edits and remixes, where he twists rock tracks into boring dancefloor cuts, characterized by swirling walls of hypnotic guitar beefed up with club beats.</p>
<p><b>DFA Records Tim Sweeney</b> joins the soiree with his own eclectic musical underpinnings. As <b>NYC's</b> own underground musical tastemaker, his prolific highly regarded radio show <b>Beats in Space</b> (www.beatsinspace.net) continues to bring the best array of electronic music styles every Tuesday night from 10.30pm to 1am on WNYU 89.1FM. Prior to joining Freeland's Marine Parade label in 2006, K-Swing had quickly risen to become America's leading lady of break beat influenced dance music. With over 20 years experience as a classically trained singer and dancer, she propelled her devotion to music and motion into DJing. She has played just about every major club in America and Canada and recently made huge noise in England at some of their most prestigious clubs like Fabric and Audio. She continues on her swift ascent to the top with her finely honed skills and new productions, including her last release with Beber, "This Is The Sound," which legendary Pete Tong called 'one of the 5 hottest tracks in the world' when it was released.</p>
