<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>Armani Exchange</strong></em> venture into the heart of New York City to bring you a new paradigm of clubbing at the <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong>. Beginning in 2010, this series of parties will be a bold and exciting excursion into nightlife with concert-style production values brought into an intimate club setting.</p>
<p>Made Event continues to live up to their title as leading producers of electronic dance music events. From choosing the most innovative venues, to booking the world’s most elite DJs, down to providing the best in visual effects, every little detail is hammered out to perfection to create a truly memorable experience.</p>
<p>This series of spectacular electronic music events is set to elevate the clubbing experience by bringing you extraordinary sound and vision with dazzling lighting, expert staging and innovative set design. Taking cues from <em><strong>Electric Zoo</strong></em>, the designer visuals and custom programming will create an immersive atmosphere to envelop you in the music.</p>
<p>Made Event’s <strong>Laura De Palma</strong> and <strong>Mike Bindra</strong> share their new vision for Nokia: “<em>We’re excited about bringing our events and production into a new space. The Nokia Theatre will elevate the nightlife experience and provide the best of both worlds – an authentic club vibe juxtaposed with first-rate big stage production values</em>.”</p>
<p>The <strong>Nokia Theatre Times Square</strong> is an indoor theater designed by award-winning architect David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group. The 2,100-capacity venue has an expansive dancefloor with staggered tiers providing unobstructed views, combined with comfy stadium seating in the rear and a chic lounge area.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2010, Made Event once again raises the bar for NYC clubbing. Welcome to a new era in dance music!</p>
