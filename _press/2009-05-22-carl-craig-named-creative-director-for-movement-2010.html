<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1503" title="Carl Craig" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/carlcraig.jpg" alt="Carl Craig" width="200" height="200" /><br />

<p>Techno Music legend <strong>Carl Craig</strong> has been named <em><strong>Creative Director</strong></em> for <strong>Movement 2010</strong>.  Paxahau made the announcement today as they prepare for the start of Movement 2009 which is set to begin on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday, May 23, 2009</strong></span> at noon.</p>
<p>“<em>Movement is already a great festival and a successful brand,</em>” said Craig, “<em>it is an honor to be involved with Movement in this new capacity.  I look forward to working with the team from Paxahau to take the artistic vision for the festival to a new level.” </em></p>
<p>In his new role Craig will be involved in various creative aspects of Movement including artist bookings and the festival’s brand image.  He will also serve as an ambassador for the Movement festival as he travels the globe performing for throngs of electronic music enthusiasts.</p>
<p>“<em>Detroit is such a wonderful music town</em>,” Craig continued.  <em>“With Movement we have such a great opportunity to remind people from around the world and those that are right here in our own backyard that electronic music in Detroit is very powerful and that our annual festival is the best stage for showcasing the most talented artists of this musical genre.”</em></p>
<p>The annual Memorial Day Weekend festival has gone through several reincarnations since its beginning in 2000.  Paxahau earned the right in 2006 to produce the festival.   Since then they have been credited with bringing financial stability to the once fledgling festival and developing a festival atmosphere that appeals to fans because of the high standard of production quality they demand and their ability to book major local and international artists year after year.</p>
<p>Paxahau representatives were elated when Craig agreed to become creative director and believe his involvement will strengthen the future of the Movement festival in Detroit.<br />
<em><br />
“We were extremely excited when Carl agreed to come on board as our new creative director,</em>” said <strong>Jason Huvaere</strong>, president of Paxahau.  “<em>He has a complete understanding of the history of Techno Music in Detroit.  He understands its impact around the world because he lives it every day."<br />
</em><br />
“<em>Carl is a musical visionary whose ambassadorship is unparalleled.  He will be able to capture the desires electronic music fans have for Movement and help us to incorporate them into future festivals</em>.”</p>
