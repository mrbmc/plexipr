<p><em><strong>Pacha NYC</strong></em> presents <em>Toolroom Knight NYC</em> with resident DJ <strong>Mark Knight</strong>, along with <strong>Dirty South</strong> and <strong>Exacta</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, June 26th, 2009</strong></span>, on the tails of Knight's much-anticipated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Toolroom Knights </span>mix compilation. With 2 CD's packed full of exclusives and killer tracks, it'll jumpstart the summer clubbing season.</p>
<p>Just when you think you know an artist, they creep up on you with something a little out of the ordinary and leave you scratching your head. Then you have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Toolroom Knights mixed by Mark Knight 2.0</span>, which is less about stealth and rather a full on frontal attack that will hammer through any previous boundaries you may have created for the next iteration of the Toolroom Records chief. The result isn’t head scratching either, but more likely to be burst ear drums and sore dancing feet, as we’re treated to a genre-busting feast of electronic music that refuses to be pigeonholed and is sourced from the deepest and most obscure corners of Mark’s own personal Toolroom. The double-compilation includes exclusive tracks from Mark Knight, Leftfield, Faithless, John Digweed &amp; Nick Muir, Audiofly, X-Press 2, Tiger Stripes and D-Formation.</p>
<p><strong>Dirty South</strong> aka Dragan Roganovic's prolific productions have propelled him into onto the worldwide stage of DJing with much aplomb. His catalog of remixes already includes a GRAMMY nomination and work for a wide range of revered artists such as; Depeche Mode, Mark Ronson, Tracey Thorn, Snoop Dogg, Roger Sanchez, Josh Wink, Tiësto, Chris Lake, Fedde Le Grande, Ferry Corsten and an upcoming one for U2. Last year his double-CD Toolroom Knights compilation included his own "Minority", which also earned him one of several Pete Tong's 'Essential New Tune' designations. Keep an ear out for his latest stormer, "Meich" with Sebastian Ingrosso this summer.</p>
<p>Now armed with his trademark house grooves and his uncanny ability to dish up ready-made dancefloor bombs, Dirty South joins Knight &amp; <strong>Exacta</strong> for an explosive night.<br />
