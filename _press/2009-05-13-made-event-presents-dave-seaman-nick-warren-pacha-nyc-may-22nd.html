<p><em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> proudly presents an exclusive pairing of two of the world’s most renowned DJ’s, <strong>Dave Seaman</strong> &amp; <strong>Nick Warren </strong>at <strong>Pacha NYC</strong> on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday, May 22, 2009</strong></span>.  After one of the most explosive and talked about events of this year’s Winter Music Conference, these two heavyweights are reuniting for an exclusive appearance at New York’s reigning superclub.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Seaman</strong> is one of the original pioneers of house music. He has been DJing for over 25 years, was the first editor of the clubbers bible; Mixmag, and has remixed and produced for everybody from U2 to David Bowie. He has also done over 20 mix compilations for the likes of Global Underground and Renaissance and been the main man behind the independent dance music labels, Stress Records and Audio Therapy.  Maintaining one of the busiest tour schedules in the business, Dave consistently finds himself at all corners of the globe pioneering a sound that only two decades of experience can produce.  Despite the constant touring, Dave still finds time for studio work of the highest caliber.  He was tapped by the Renaissance flagship mix series for the 10th installment, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renaissance: The Masters Series 10</span> and another compilation for his own label Audio Therapy recordings - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapy Sessions 4 mixed by Dave Seaman.</span> His recent collaboration with Josh Gabriel entitled “Hayaah” is sure to set dance floors ablaze this summer and with several new productions and two compilations on the horizon, Dave Seaman maintains his status as one of the busiest figures in the business.</p>
<p>You can tell when <strong>Nick Warren</strong>'s on the decks when the music emanating from the DJ booth is that perfect club mix of driving percussion and soaring musicality. With over two decades of experience Nick remains at the forefront of club culture.  Packing clubs and arenas from London to Los Angeles his name has become synonymous with underground musical integrity and commercial success.   Having recently put out his eighth release on the renowned Global Underground imprint with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Underground 035: Lima</span>, he has become one of the top-selling DJ’s of all time.  In addition to his extensive DJ work, Nick’s presence is felt in all aspects of the industry.  Along with partner Jody Wisternoff, Nick formed <em>Way Out West </em>in 1997.  With four full length albums to their credit, Way Out West has placed themselves in the upper echelon of dance music groups.  Now the Way Out West duo have finished up their next album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We Love Machine</span> due out in October 2009 with plenty of tracks being road tested in clubs around the world. In the meantime, as head of A &amp; R for Hope Recordings, Nick is able to use the platform to stay current and further provide dance floors with the shifting tides of dance music movements.</p>
