<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.paxahau.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-1481 aligncenter" title="paxahau" src="http://www.plexipr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/paxahau2.gif" alt="paxahau" width="600" height="95" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MOVEMENT 2009 $45 WEEKEND PASS;<br />
GOES UP TO $50 ON MAY 15th </strong></p>
<p><strong>Movement 2009</strong> pre-sale weekend passes will only be $45 until <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, May 15th</span>, when they will increase to $50. Movement weekend passes have been selling at a rapid pace. The numbers of passes sold are already double what they were last year at this time.</p>
<p><em>“We are very proud of the fact that even in this tough economy we were able to keep the weekend passes to Movement moderately priced,”</em> said Jason Huvaere, Director of the Festival. <em>“It’s the largest electronic music event in the country and the experience we are able to give music fans is far greater than the price of the ticket.  There is no place else where someone can go to see 36 hours of music on four stages being performed by world-renowned musicians at this ticket price.”</em></p>
<p>As of Sunday, May 10 some 2,377 weekend passes have been purchased for Movement 2009.  At the same time last year, only 1,141 weekend passes had been purchased for Movement 2008.  VIP ticket purchases are up this year to 422 from 273 last year.</p>
<p>Movement 2009 organizers are encouraging electronic music enthusiasts to take advantage of the discount presale weekend pass special.  Prices will increase at the gate. They will be:</p>
<p>* $30 for an Individual Day Pass<br />
* $60 for a Weekend Pass<br />
* $150 for a VIP Pass</p>
<p>On average between 6,000 and 10,000 tickets are bought at the gate each of the three days of the festival.</p>
<p>Passes can be purchased online at <a href="http://">www.wantickets.com</a>.  Movement Weekend Passes can also be purchased (cash only) at various locations including: 323East in Royal Oak; Spectacles in Detroit; Record Time in Roseville; and Gramophone in Chicago.  VIP tickets can also be purchased at 323 East in Royal Oak and Spectacles in Detroit.</p>
<p>Last year nearly 80,000 people passed through the turnstiles at Hart Plaza for Movement 2008.</p>
