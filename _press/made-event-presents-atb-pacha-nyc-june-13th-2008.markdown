Made Event presents<br />
ATB<br />
With Randy Boyer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents one of the world's most talented and in-demand DJ/Producers, <strong>ATB</strong>, for an evening of intense electronic dance music at<strong> Pacha NYC</strong>, on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, June 13th, 2008</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Few have been able to match the commercial and underground success of Andre Tanneberger, aka, <strong>ATB</strong>. From the start, he has provided us with timeless classics including his first hit in 1999 "9 P.M. (Till I Come)" which catapulted him onto the global scene. Using this success ATB was able to produce five albums in eleven years. Four of which made it into the German Top 10. His resume includes countless remixes and productions and has worked with everyone from Moby to Enigma and even rock star Bryan Adams.</p>
<p>His unique sound is his trademark and what his fans have come to adore. He has the ability to fuse ambient and trance with a wide variety of musical influences that has allowed for his accomplishments. A perfect example is his newest album titled "Trilogy". The album was a clear-cut illustration of how electronic music can work beautifully with 'handmade music' or music made from real instruments, producing two hit singles in 'Renegade' and 'Feelin Alive'.</p>
<p>This year ATB's goal is to work on his next album and to tour in countries he has never played to. He just completed his first tour of South America and with great success, returned to Europe with shows across the continent. Adorned by many, ATB is a fixture at all major festivals and events, especially Loveparade, one of his personal favorites. When he touches down in New York City for his Pacha event, he will have just finished an appearance at Global Gathering. With the intensity the Gathering provides, New York will be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>
