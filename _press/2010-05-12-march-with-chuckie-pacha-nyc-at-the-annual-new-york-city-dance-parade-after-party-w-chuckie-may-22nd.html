<p>Chuckie has been making a name for himself around the world by putting his signature deep, dirty house sound on remixes for David Guetta, Bob Sinclar and Joachim Gaurraud. His talent for building insanely intense climaxes, then delivering devastatingly explosive beats, is no child’s play. Killer original tracks like “Let The Bass Kick” have launched him into the top 10 British Singles Charts and won him praise from Swedish House Mafia, Laidback Luke and Pete Tong. In summer 2008, David Guetta handpicked Chuckie to play at his event at Pacha in Ibiza, saying “<em>he is mixing the hip-hop vibe with house music like no one else!</em>” Chuckie has won numerous accolades, including the Dutch TMF “Best Dance DJ” Award last year, for which he beat out super DJs Tiësto and Armin Van Buuren. This year, he also won the inaugural Best Remix Data Award in L.A. for his remix of David Guetta’s “Sexy Bitch.”</p>
<p>In 2005, Chuckie created the now-legendary, always sold-out “Dirty Dutch” house music event, attended by over thirty thousand music lovers. Dirty Dutch made its WMC debut at Cameo in Miami this year, featuring Chuckie himself, Estelle, Afrojack and Sidney Samson (among others), and he plans to bring the party to selected cities around the globe. Indeed, Chuckie is taking over the U.S. in 2010 with a freshly inked multi-album deal with Atlantic Records and work with stars like Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy, Lil Jon, Toni Braxton and Akon.</p>
