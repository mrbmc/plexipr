<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>‘THIS IS SANDER KLEINENBERG 2’</strong><br />
(ULTRA RECORDS / SEPTEMBER 8TH)</p>
<p>Pioneering International DJ, producer and label boss<strong> Sander Kleinenberg</strong> releases his impressive new mix compilation called ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This Is Sander Kleinenberg 2</strong></span>’ on<em> Ultra Records</em> this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>September 9, 2009</strong></span>. This compilation truly displays how versatile Sander can be, drawing on a vast array of styles and using them in an innovative way to create his unparalleled sound. Each disc offers something slightly different and follows on brilliantly from his hugely popular first compilation in the series.</p>
<p>The first disc, ‘Left’, kicks things off with a laid back atmospheric slice of electronic bliss called ‘Summer Rain’ from Bpitch control’s starlet Sascha Funke. From there the mix builds effortlessly blending a fine selection of different House styles. Hotly tipped Hamburg producer Martin Stimming being well represented on this comp with two brilliant tracks, starting with “Silver surfer”, followed by a co-production with Mladen Solomun, called “Feuervogel”. Berlin producer David Keno “Replika” track is also signed to Sander’s own Little Mountain Recordings.  As far as the origin of tracks is concerned we’re staying in Germany for a while. H.O.S.H. was responsible for a great “Downstairs” remix, originally produced by Lucy. Great Stuff label boss Rainer Weichhold is responsible for twisting Rockers Hi-Fi’s “Push push“ and the previously unreleased Sultan and Ned Shepard remix of ‘Asteroidz’ by DBN featuring Matida. This disc has a very sexy, uplifting and funky feel to it which just leaves you wanting more.</p>
<p>The second disc, ‘Right’, shows Sander’s rougher and tougher side. It commences with a spoken word vocal sample, "<em>Little boy...Little girl...evil dope</em>" looping over the beginning to Kleinenberg's latest dance floor homage and his first single in three years entitled, "This Is Our Night". The noteworthy single features Sander's signature synth bounce and vocal and has been charted in the top 10 on Beatport's Electro House &amp; Progressive charts, as well as #1 on DMC's Buzz Chart. Following suit is Rene Amesz’s previously unreleased Electro/Tribal track ‘Ridicule’. The mix develops with some driving tech-house including Luetzenkirchen’s ‘Foxy’ and DJ Ortzy’s exclusive Dirty Flavor compilation remix of ‘Massive’. Sander powers the mix home with Dabruck &amp; Klein’s dominant peak time electro remix of Joachim Garraud’s ‘The answer’ and concludes with Mason’s brilliant chilled Refurb mix of ‘Kippschwinger’.</p>
<p>On the horizon, keep an ear out for Sander’s debut artist album due in early 2010. The album contains a plethora of amazing new productions, which he has worked on with U.S. heavyweight Josh Gabriel. The first single from the album will be Sander’s remarkable new tune “This Is Our Night” which has already gained support from BBC Radio 1’s Pete Tong.</p>
