<p>Few artists can boast a resume like Ali "Dubfire" Shirazania can.  A body of work that includes Grammy Awards, performances at the world's finest venues, collaborations with some of the biggest artists around and of course his partnership as 1/2 of the legendary electronic duo DEEP DISH.  With an array of remixes, productions, mix CD's, as well as critically and commercially acclaimed artist albums, Dubfire has been able to do what few other electronic artists have, conquer the world of underground electronic music, as well as make a significant impact within the mainstream.  Following a creative hiatus from partner Sharam, Dubfire started his foray into solo artist expression with "I Feel Speed", an indie rock/techno mash up that, in addition to top notch production, saw him step up to the microphone for vocal duties.  The now classic "Roadkill" and "Ribcage" followed, the former being nominated for the "Club Banger of the Year" award at the Club World Awards and the latter being one of Beatports top 100 singles of all time, along with his remix of "Grindhouse" which was designated Beatport's #3 Best Single of 2008. He also put out a variety of remixes on such prestigious labels as Cocoon, Get Physical, M_NUS, and Rekkids, as well as a critically acclaimed 2CD mix for Global Underground.</p>
<p>2008 has continued this impressive trend for Dubfire.  His Science + Technology Digital Audio (Sci + Tec) imprint has grown from a platform for original productions to release a wide array of formats, as well as break in new talent such as Delete, Paul Ritch, The Dolphins and a hot, new release from South America's Rocha &amp; Lewinger entitled "Dub Screamer/Santiago." The label also currently boasts a roster of proven talent that includes Steve Lawler, Christian Smith &amp; John Selway, and Zoo Brazil.  After receiving two Beatport awards (Best Minimal and Best Techno Artist), completing remixes for UNKLE, RadioSlave, and Booka Shade, and a #30 spot on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJ's list, one can see that Dubfire continues to prove himself as a dance floor heavyweight while staying true to his "punk ethic" that, in his own words, "must be groundbreaking, futuristic, unique, and organic." Recently, Dubfire formed a new production collaboration with Oliver Huntemann with their first release "Dios" out now on Ideal Records.</p>
