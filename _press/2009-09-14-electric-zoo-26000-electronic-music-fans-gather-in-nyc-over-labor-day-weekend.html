<p>“<em>Electric Zoo was an incredible first festival for us,</em>” said Made Event’s Laura De Palma &amp; Mike Bindra. “<em>The natural beauty of Randall’s Island Park, the wide selection of musical choices, and the excitement of fellow beat junkies, all culminated in a successful inaugural festival. We look forward to bringing it for many years to come.</em>”</p>
<p><strong>Sirius XM</strong> Radio broadcasted live all weekend from Electric Zoo on AREA (SIRIUS channel 38 and XM channel 80) to their 36 million audience.  All across the nation, listeners were able to groove to live sets and interviews with superstar DJ artists, producers and remixers, including; David Guetta, Armin Van Buuren, Deadmau5, Ferry Corsten, Robbie Rivera, ATB, and much more! Due to popular demand, tune in next weekend on Sirius XM for the exclusive re-broadcast, “<em><strong>Electric Zoo-Back to the Zoo</strong></em>” on September 18 – 20.</p>
<p>Electric Zoo thanks all the festival goers who make an event like this possible - here’s to the start of something special.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"<em>Electric Zoo was the best gig I've ever played in NYC.  The whole festival was just fantastic, the fans were so ecstatic and I was so happy to be there.  Whoever says that there is not a dance music scene in the United States is wrong, there is definitely a big scene that is constantly growing and Electric Zoo is a great example.  I can't wait to come back and play in New York again!</em>" - <strong>David Guetta </strong></p>
<p>"<em>It was so refreshing to finally see an event of this size take place in our hometown. I do not remembering seeing so many beaming, smiling faces in the same  place celebrating their love of music. A perfect end to this Summer. Much props to the entire crew at Made Event for making  this happen so flawlessly, and here's hoping that it will become one of our institutions for years to come!</em>" – <strong>François K</strong></p>
<p>"<em>This is really special. I think NY has been crying out for this for a long, long time. And obviously it’s all happening. The production is phenomenal, the hospitality is exceptional. I can only say great things about this because so far it’s all been perfect, all boxes ticked!</em>"  - <strong>Tom Middleton </strong></p>
<p>“<em>I was excited to see a purely electronic festival in New York City. To my knowledge the first of its kind and was a success. A big triumph for the big apple</em>.” –<strong>Steve Aoki</strong></p>
