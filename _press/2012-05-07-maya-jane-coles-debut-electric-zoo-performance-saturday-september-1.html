<p><strong>Maya Jane Coles</strong>, one of the great rising powers in house music, will be joining the <strong>Electric Zoo Festival</strong> for the first time this year. She will be playing at the Sunday School Grove on <strong>Saturday, September 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Called <em>“the one to watch”</em> by DJ Mag, Maya has experienced a meteoric rise to the top since her new-classic anthem “What They Say” broke during the fall of 2010, followed by the EPs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Humming Bird</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Now</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beat Faster</span>. 2011 accordingly saw numerous high achievements: she was named ‘Best Breakthrough DJ’ by Mixmag, debuted at No. 9 in Resident Advisor’s DJ Poll, won ‘Best Newcomer’ at the Ibiza DJ Awards, and was voted ‘Producer of the Year’ in DJ Mag.</p>
<p>Recently Maya crafted the latest installment of the renowned DJ-Kicks mix series, released on !K7 Records in April. <em>"I wanted this mix to showcase my diversity,"</em> says Coles. <em>"I don't just do one thing and I wanted it to reflect that. Most of the mixes I've put out there so far have been house based, but I also produce stuff under the Nocturnal Sunshine moniker, which is more two-step/bass influenced stuff. This mix evolved into something that wasn't just four-to-the-floor."</em></p>

<p>The mix opens with muted synth chords and broken post-garage beats of "Loquz &amp; Past" by Deft, gradually acquiring more rhythmic weight care of tracks like "In My Cocoon" by Bozwell, a moody throb of glassy-sounding electronics, and Coles' own "Not Listening," a driving cut built on a pounding yet melodic groove and exclusive to the mix. Another exclusive is "Meant To Be," released under her Nocturnal Sunshine guise, which marks the mix's transition to a more shuffley, two-step-influenced section. The word journey is often used to describe DJ sets, too often, perhaps - but it applies in the case, on a grand scale.</p>

<p><strong>About Maya Jane Coles</strong><br />
Maya Jane Cole’s journey to the top of the house music world began at the age of 15 years old with hip-hop production. This soon evolved into dubbier creations, and eventually to drum and bass before she found the sound that typifies her career today. A string of hi-powered releases, including the smash single “What They Say,” and the EPs Humming Bird, Focus Now and Beat Faster secured countless accolades for the young prodigy, including (in 2011 alone) a vote as DJ Mag’s ‘Producer of the Year,’ ‘Best Breakthrough DJ’ in Mixmag and ‘Best Newcomer’ at the Ibiza DJ Awards. 2012 has seen Maya release a well-received DJ-Kicks mix, and build intense anticipation for a full-length artist album, the release date of which has not yet been announced.</p>
