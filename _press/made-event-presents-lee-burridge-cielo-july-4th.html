Made Event presents<br />
Lee Burridge</strong></p>
<p><strong>Made Event</strong> presents one of the most consistent and globally acclaimed DJs, <strong>Lee Burridge</strong>, performing at <strong>Cielo</strong> on Independence Day - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, July 4th, 2008.</span></strong></p>
<p>In a congested arena of DJ's vying for recognition and attention, <strong>Lee Burridge </strong>is an anomaly. In a career that spans over two decades, Lee is the definition of an iron man. Constantly on the move, he has played internationally including landmark festivals such as Love Parade, Exit, Creamfields, Dance Valley, Coachella and others. He is known for his wonky, bouncy, sublime house and techno sets and his Cielo performance is not to be missed.</p>
<p>In 2005 Burridge started what is known as project ‘365' which provided him with bi-monthly residencies in seven different cities around the world (New York, Ibiza, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Denver &amp; Hong Kong). The purpose; for him to build a solid relationship with his audiences and to expand the impact an international DJ can have in one region. Now, three years after, Lee is teaming up with local producers in each of those cities to work in the studio and release what are surely destined to be dancefloor hits.</p>
<p>Most recently, his contribution to the dance music compilation "Balance Series" (Balance 012) has gained much praise and continues to win over new fans. The mix is Burridge's first solo compilation since 2003's Global Underground '24:7', and the three discs present a tidy snapshot of the current state of house and techno. It ranges from deep house to intricate minimal to more pumping techno, culminating in a deep, beautiful, dark, trippy and wobbly soundtrack. Featuring a wide array of cutting edge artists including Martin Buttrich, Dennis Ferrer, Alexi Delano, Gabriel Ananda and more.</p>
