<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cielo : June 2009 News</strong></p>
<p>To his mum he’s Adam Carthy, to the rest of us he’s the genius known as <strong>Mr. Scruff</strong>. Hailing from Manchester, England, Mr. Scruff is known for lengthy DJ journeys and broad musical taste. A DJ who joined the musical dots others didn’t even know existed, not to impress but to maintain a flow for the dancers allowing him free reign to jumble jazz, house, hip-hop, ska, ragga, dub, blues, soul and rock ‘n’ roll all into the mix. At such hoedowns Mr. Scruff makes a difference by making his own rules and adhering to Frank Zappa’s durable epithet that “if music be the food of love, nobody wants to eat cabbage all night!” Hear his musical collage for yourself on Monday, June 1st on a night of seriously eclectic beats courtesy of <em><strong>Deep Space</strong></em>.</p>
<p>On Thursday April 4th <em><strong>Dance.Here.Now</strong></em>. presents a Nervous Records release party for ‘Whateva’ featuring the multifaceted<strong> Peter Rauhofer</strong>. Producer, remixer, DJ, and owner of Star 69 Records, Rauhofer isn’t easily described by one label. The same could be said of the man’s DJ sets, to which the Austrian-born New Yorker comments: “I play tribal house, deep house, some vocals, some classics. You have to take people on a journey throughout the night. If you come to the club for only one hour you don’t get the full effect of what I’m trying to do. If you come at 2am you might hear tribal, at 4am deep house or at 6am classics. I usually don’t have just one style that I play.” So to get the full PR experience come early and stay late.</p>
<p><strong>Marques Wyatt</strong>, monthly summer residency at <strong>Cielo</strong> kicks things on Friday, June 5th with his notorious<em><strong> Deep </strong></em>night. His acclaimed LA parties of the same name have now been running for over a decade, and shows no signs of letting up, indeed many say the Californian was responsible for the birth of the West Coast house scene after bringing the fresh sounds of New York to Los Angeles in the mid-80s. Channeling a spiritual depth cultivated through meditation, prayer and yoga practice, Marques continues to spread the gospel of house music as an evangelist of music and “Deep” culture by globe-trotting everywhere from Shanghai to Barcelona and Tel Aviv to Dubai with a mission to bring musical unity and light to all souls in his pathway. Expect a self-assured set of deep soulful grooves with a spiritual message to match.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vibal</strong></em>, <strong>Tedd Patterson</strong>’s celebrated night, returns on Saturday, June 6th and as with what’s gone before you know it’ll be another edifying soul-satisfying selection of gospel enriched house, and gargantuan garage grooves – his signature sound incorporating an intoxicating blend of contemporary and classic dance styles. A wise and magical character of the dance scene whose style owes as much to the past as to the present, Tedd’s been spinning since the 1970s and his no musical boundaries only musical journeys that have seen him become a DJ’s DJ as his legendary Magic Sessions sets at the Winter Music Conference in the ‘90s will attest. Forever deepening the range of today’s dance music, he mixes tribal, deep, and progressive styles of house with afro-beats and disco tracks reflecting his diverse array of influences.</p>
<p>It’s birthday celebration time on Wednesday, June 10th as our <em><strong>Roots</strong></em> residents <strong>Kevin Hedge</strong> raises a glass to toast the continued success and happiness of his musical partner and fellow soul aficionado, <strong>Louie Vega</strong>. The man dubbed “Little Louie” Vega has also been called the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible to categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and revolutionizing music itself in the process. During his two-decade plus career, he’s crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history and kick started the whole soulful house genre with groundbreaking records, along with revitalizing and exposing legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito Puente to a new market and generation alike. The night will also see Louie showcasing artists from his Vega Records imprint.</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 11th <em><strong>Dance.Here.Now</strong></em>. celebrates its third 3rd anniversary by flying in from Spain two of tribal house’s hottest DJ/production teams, <strong>Chus &amp; Ceballos</strong>. Hailing from Madrid, the dynamic duo has effortlessly carved out a secure slot amongst the elite with numerous slices of picture perfect modern house productions on their Stereo Productions imprint. Famous for their trademark Iberian sound - a delicious blend of hypnotizing warm and inviting tribal soundscapes laced with modern tech elements - C&amp;C have cornered the market with their satisfying and unique sound that has also seen them feature on key labels including Yoshitoshi, Shinichi, Renaissance and NRK. But perhaps the biggest compliment we can give them comes is to quote a certain Danny Tenaglia who’s gone on record to say: “Thank God for Chus &amp; Ceballos!”</p>
<p>Whether it was his critically acclaimed debut on the <em>BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix</em>, or his rise to number 23 in the definitive <em>DJ Mag Top 100 </em>poll, there wasn’t much that didn’t go right for <strong>Gareth Emery</strong> in 2008, a year that saw him become increasingly established as one of the most innovative, unique, and exciting figures in modern dance music. Find out what all the hype is about is about on Friday, June 12th as <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> welcomes from England one of the hottest new stars of trance, Gareth Emery. Armin, Tiesto, Oakenfold, and Judge Jules are all fully paid-up members of the Emery fan club, while both Ferry Corsten and Paul van Dyk have tipped him as a future star.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>‘Cielo: Playtime</strong></em></span>’ is the title of the latest in the critically acclaimed compilation series mixed by Cielo residents and all round nice guys <strong>Nicolas Matar</strong> and <strong>Willie Graff</strong>. The 2CD set features deep and soulful tracks from some of house music’s most popular and influential artists including Charles Webster, Rocco, Kerri Chandler, Louie Vega’s Elements of Life collective, Kings of Tomorrow, Barbara Tucker, Robert Owens and Kenny Larkin. The album is available to buy and download from Tommy Boy from June 9th, and on Saturday, June 13th <strong>Paradizo</strong> features a special release party hosted by Nicolas Matar no doubt featuring a plethora of edifyingly rich material from the album.</p>
<p>Arriving off the back of sell-out dates in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, <strong>James Zabiela </strong>touches down on the US leg of his global tour at Cielo on Thursday, June 18th as guest of<em><strong> Dance.Here.Now</strong></em>. The jet setting DJ first came to our attention back in 2000 as his signature fusion of breaks and house helped him win <em>Muzik </em>magazine’s Bedroom Bedlam competition and a regular place alongside Sasha in the process. Hailing from Southampton on the south coast of England, James places as much emphasis on diversity as on quality, so expect a night of hot sweaty techno-laced house blended with a variety of styles.</p>
<p>"Gotta wait 'til the sun goes down, before they come out to play.  If there's a jam anywhere around, you can bet they'll find their way." Party people, On Friday, June 19th <em><strong>Adult Section</strong></em> is back after a long winter break to celebrate another summer in our fair city.  One constant during this time of great change is our need to let loose.  Come live it up as they entertain you with music of the highest order at one of the world's best venues.  Discotized, left-field, timeless grooves for your heart &amp; brain and rhythms to drive your body insane. Our selectors <strong>Citizen Kane </strong>(Disques Sinthomme) and <strong>Darshan Jesrani </strong>(MetroArea) pilot this starship to your destination, while Cielo's excellent soundsystem, great acoustics, lovely staff and cozy environ provide the stage for your good time.  Smart, sweet &amp; nasty, tough &amp; classy, come hang with us a while, transgressin style, in the Adult Section.</p>
<p>Growing up in St. Petersburg, in the old Soviet Union, <strong>Serge Devant</strong> was enrolled at an early age into the city’s prestigious music school where he was classically trained in both violin and piano. Those very same skills he now incorporates into his productions and DJ sets – a grittier side of experimental electronica with sparse, dark progressive elements that release the mind and stimulate the senses. With ‘Wanderer’, his new artist album out now on Ultra Records, <em><strong>Area Events </strong></em>presents the official Serge Devant launch party on Thursday, June 25th. Hear for yourself why Tiesto named him one of the brightest sparks in dance music and one of his top five favorite DJs; Serge’s talents were even recognized by Coca-Cola, who last year asked him to compose an exclusive track for the Olympics in Beijing!</p>
<p>Not to show bias for featuring Josh Gabriel (one half of the now defunct Gabriel &amp; Dresden production partnership) last month, on Friday, June 26th. the <em><strong>Made Event</strong></em> features his former cohort and a true dance music junkie,<strong> Dave Dresden</strong>. For the last 15 years he’s committed himself to music with a career spanning every aspect of the industry, working as a DJ, journalist, A&amp;R, radio music director, and remixer. As you’d expect from the well-traveled maestro of prog-house, the night’s sure to be an hallucinogenic journey through anthemic vocal numbers, ethereal moods and, of course, the best in progressiveness.</p>
