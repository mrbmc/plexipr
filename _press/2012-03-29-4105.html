<p><strong>March 31 - Martin Solveig</strong><br />
Martin Solveig said "Hello" to a worldwide audience in 2010, releasing a track that has now sold over 2 million copies worldwide, achieving platinum status in the United States, Italy, Germany, Austria, and double-platinum in Canada and Australia. This breakthrough production was the result of 10 years spent building his now prolific body of work, from his first studio album 'Sur La Terre' in 2002 to 'SMASH,' his 4th full-length release, which is still moving through a territory-by-territory release schedule today. In addition to his own solo work, Martin was the main collaborator on Madonna's new album 'MDNA,' and will be supporting her on 20 tour dates this year. His next release 'The Night Out' EP is due out this April on Big Beat/Atlantic.</p>
